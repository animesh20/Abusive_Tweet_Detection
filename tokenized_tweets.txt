<user> <user> you can stop the " one muslim " nonsense . look at what the muslims tell the pollsters . <url> racism
<user> <user> the difference is that islam has a requirement for jihad , has over <number> large terrorist orgs . , and declared war on world racism

<user> <user> every religion and non religion on the planet is at war with islam . every border with a muslim state is a bloody border racism
<user> yes , the western world was unaware of the layer of islamolunatics that lived under the thumbs of the dictators . racism

<user> unfortunately , real islam , as defined in the quran and hadith , is too backwards and inhuman even for most me muslims . racism
<user> and since islam declared war on all humanity . humanity must return the favor and declare war on islam . racism
<user> what are you talking about provocation ? islam declared war with the world . that is more than enough provocation . racism
<user> how many muslims there are is irrelevant . the declaration of war on mankind is clearly spelled out in quran and hadiths . racism
<user> it's muslims that do virtually all the killing . for example , <percent> of civilians killed in afghanistan are killed by taliban . racism
<user> hamas was elected once and have not had elections since . they have skipped many elections . mursi was going in same direction racism
<user> and if muslims are angry that they can not force islam on people , who cares ? <url> racism
<user> wrong . apostacy is the equivalent of leaving america and becoming a citizen of another country . there is no penalty . racism
<user> the hypocrisy of islam is that they expect to convert people from other religions but they murder converts from their own . racism
<user> and furthermore , they murder anyone who tries to convert a muslim , but demand the freedom to convert non muslims . racism
<user> islam is an entire religion built on intolerance and jihad . it's time for the world to stop tolerating it . racism
<user> actually , muslims enslaved far more than anyone else . the prophet mohammed was a slave trader . jesus had no slaves . racism
<user> furthermore , the muslims were the last to give up slavery , and many only did it under pressure from the west . racism
<user> but the western world gave up slavery on it's own . no one forced them from the outside . racism
<user> and now , every jihadi group wants to reinstate slavery in the present because the quran approves it and mohammed practiced . racism
<user> so if you are against slavery , you cannot be a muslim . so why are you crying about slavery when the quran approves it ? racism
<user> the first slaughterers were the muslims . they invaded the christian world <number> years before the crusades . racism
<user> the muslims conquered <number> / <number> of the christian world before it attacked back . so again , what are you crying about . racism
<user> the muslims also invaded india and murdered <number> million hindus . they virtually exterminated all buddhist on in india . racism
<user> the muslims attacked and murdered the zoroastrians in persia and the buddhists in afghanistan . racism
<user> no minorities of any kind are left in saudi and several other gulf states , having been exterminated by muslims . racism
<user> now muslim terror groups are trying to complete the job of killing or throwing out any remaining minority groups in arabia . racism
<user> islam is the most genocidal religion on the planet . mankind must exterminate islam or be exterminated by it . racism
<user> because while other groups can evolve , the violence of the quran and hadith prevent islam from ever being a human religion . racism
<user> the lesson the world learned about islam is that when we get rid of their brutal dictators , they are replaced by brutal islamists racism

doin ' stuff . <url> none
<user> <user> it goes both ways . this is from a very limited sample size - people are far less likely to harass on fbwith real names . none
<user> <user> but i have only discussed with other members of targeted harassment from this specific group . can not speak for other hate groups none
<user> <user> the fact that twitter makes it easier to interact with those you are not connected to may have more to do with this . none

<user> er , into a single model i mean . from multiple corpuses . or whatever . none
<user> <user> i thought it was looking at tweet ids or dates . i am pulling from multiple user accounts . none
<user> <user> oh i just saw the latest version has consume - all ( but help docs are bugged , btw . ) none
<user> <user> consume_all vs consume - all , does not mention model name must be first . none

devopsing so hard right now . <url> none

i hate configuring retention policies and flush intervals in statsd / graphite . ugh <elongated> . none
can i make graphite show the sum of 5 m when retention is 1 m ? want to see a graph with point every 5 m with sum of that time period . none
<user> i have no idea what these mean : request context , series list . guessing interval string would be 5 m ? none
<user> i have not really had to go plonking around in graphite before . this stuff is practically a foreign language . none
<user> hmm . using grafana , and it's giving me errors . none
<user> summarize ( stats . counters . tweetstats . hashtag . all . count , ' 5 m ' , ' sum ' ) none
been doing things . going to have some pretty automated stuff to show you all soon , but for now , some kinda neat stuff i found . none
disclaimer : none of these things i am about to tell you are <percent> accurate . just mostly <emphasis> accurate . there are always exceptions . none
in the past <number> hrs , gg hashtag saw <number> tweets / hr ( <number> of which were rts ) . min : <number> ( <number> ) max : <number> ( <number> ) . majority of non - rt came from bot none
tweets which saw the most rts tend to be questionable , abusive , and almost always aimed at <user> , <user> , <user> , and me . none
in the past 1 2 h , <user> is seeing the most targeted abuse , with <number> ( <number> oc / <number> rt ) gg hashtaged tweets mentioning her . congrats ! none
this is followed not - so - closely by <user> , with <number> ( <number> oc / <number> rt ) gg hashtagged tweets mentioning her . better luck next time . none
when we look at all mentions of a username , including rts , <user> has received <number> in the past 1 2 h . <user> has received <number> . none
can not wait until i get more data on this . but it looks like <user> should probably avoid her mentions at <number> - <time> <allcaps> pdt </allcaps> sundays . <wink> none
<user> <user> rofl none
rt <user> : <user> <user> probably uses ggautoblocker ( which she authored ) which blocks lots of innocents . totally not  none
<user> <user> well , find me some tweets where the hashtag is mentioned + us saying something that is not questionable or abusive ? none
<user> <user> oh , darn , you can not ? shoot . none
<user> <user> not enough data to know for certain . just what i am seeing today . she ' s getting a pretty steady level since then none
rt <user> : <user> <user> " could ' ve fooled anyone ! " was this too subtle ? <url> none
<user> hm ? none
literally <hashtag> devops </hashtag> none
<user> we could do something fun with this . i could see how many tweets you get from users you have blocked . none
the goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up - to - the - minute stats on this stuff . none
i am starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen , so it could be an interesting incident notification tool . none
however , it does not scale . i can use this to track up to a certain number of users . if they target a user i am not looking at , will not work . none
it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs , i guess , and * . wsp files that are deleted if they are not updated in n minutes ? none
but that seems gross , and not really how this tool should be used . can do better without her things , this is more for an overview . none
<user> <user> wsp is . <repeated> sigh . but i am just using docker in aws with a grafana image . fuck configuring this crap . none
<user> <user> i got statsd / graphite working on freebsd once , but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed ? ! <repeated> none
<user> <user> i do not wanna devops this . i just want it to work so i can do other things . i need a devops . none
<user> yeah . i am kind of feeling like for what i am doing , wsp is ok . for doing more granular monitoring , redis would be good . none
<user> no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis , tho . i ' d have to learn r or somesuch . none
<user> <user> oh dear none
<user> <user> no . something went awry , box ran out of memory . it's also a dev box . none
<user> <user> looking into it , ty for the headsup . none
<user> <user> <user> yeah , i have got a cron to kick it . it must not be kicking it properly . none
<user> <user> <user> or it's not responding to kill signals . weird <elongated> . because i ran the script manually and it worked . none
<user> <user> <user> getting into inst is slow . it's oomed . prob going to have to aws console and kick it . none
<user> they are already setting up bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it . i do not really see this making much of a difference . none
<user> but if they do , i am happy to turn my graphs over to twitter ' s abuse department . i do not think the people i am watching would risk that . none
<user> <user> i love those too much . <allcaps> too much </allcaps> . none
so , i guess i need new jeans . or a belt . or maybe just some cat5 , if i am keeping it real . <url> none
that's about <number> " , i think . none
<user> cigarette trousers ? none
<user> they are all pretty much synonyms . cigarette , pencil , skinny , etc . none
<user> eh , it happened . i did not set out to lose weight or anything . none
i just saw that <number> people requested that i update my amazon wish - list . hm . i usually only use it to track things i plan on buying eventually . none

fellow sockphiles : <url> none
i think we really need to talk about these , too : <url> none
<user> why would it ? none
<user> <user> unclear . tos prevents bots from being able to contact you without you contacting them first , iirc . none
<user> <user> automated programs , whatever . it's not clearly written . none
rt <user> : i speak for " go fuck yourself , you do not get to choose my priorities , buttpirate . " none
<user> it's what i am trying <emphasis> to do , at least targeting specific groups / causes . it's tricky . have to look more at statistics than words . none
<user> ie : things not as open for interpretation , such as numeric or boolean data ( is following / is not following , etc ) . none
<user> it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups . i think it ' ll be useful . none
<user> rather amused that despite their protests , gg is the only group i have looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers none
<user> <user> previous versions of ebooks_example ( code using twitter_ebooks ) would not reply to * _ebooks accounts . none
<user> <user> the latest version does not take this into account , iirc . i just added it to my custom bot blacklist . none
<user> oh , they are . they did not hurt after the first day or two . none
<user> <user> <user> he ' s ok . if we were stranded , both hungry , and i had a sandwich , i would probably give him half . none
gag <emphasis> <url> <hashtag> stop wadhwa2015 </hashtag> none
verified accts for all is an ok idea , but too much administrative overhead . there are better ways , which i have talked about in the past . none
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not . not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have . none
however , twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools / exp . that's why devpolicy does not really encourage 3rd party clients . none
the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists . eng / infra is already there . expose if a # has been added via metadata . none
add a filter to toggle showing phone - verified accts in clients ( requires devpolicy update , natch ) . none
does have some drawbacks . but a 2nd toggle saying ' show me accts older than n days ' is easy . metadata already exists . client / policy update . none
phone # idea is not perfect ( it's easy enough to grab a phone # from gv ) , but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse . none
in short , there needs to be a verified that is not verified . requiring govt ids will cause probs . unique phone less problematic , not perfect . none
do not worry , i am sure no one will be like " <allcaps> what a great idea </allcaps> " until a dude takes credit for it . < <number> none
<user> a lot of people do not have cell phones . i was one of them for <number> years . <wink> i only used gv . against the idea of disallowing gv . none
<user> not everyone can afford cell phones . gv is a good alternative . we do not want to turn twitter into a classist thing . none
<user> i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago , talked about it here a month ago ( neener ) . <tong> none
<user> unaware of their issues . do they not have cell phones / access to gv ? none
<user> i have seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for <allcaps> sms </allcaps> . none
<user> <user> this is not de - anonymizing . the phone # would not necessarily be stored . no names would be required . none
<user> it's very easy to change your gv #. none
it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity . none
pseudonyms are good . own it ! anonymous is not the same thing . what jason / wadhwa are promoting would require id / home address / <allcaps> pay to use </allcaps> none
go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite do not realize that some people can not afford <money> / month to not be harassed . none
whispers <emphasis> hey guys . being free from abuse / harassment does not have to be monetized . it should be for everyone . i can show you the way . none
take off your vc fedoras and think about what this really is . it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed & threatened . none
so , my yammering sleazeball cupcakes , you can go with <url> and i will go my way . i fight for the users . none
<user> you do not have to have a phone to get <allcaps> sms </allcaps> . you have to have internet . which is also required for twitter . none
<user> <user> the number does not have to be stored to be ensured unique . <repeated> none
<user> <user> think about how passwords work . are they stored in plaintext ? can the provider easily decrypt them ? nope . none
<user> oh god that sounds like a horrible idea . privacy problems . also , twitter likely would not be storing the number . that would be bad . none
i am still entertained that jason ' s idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected . i ' d love to hear his thoughts on short skirts . none
<user> i think we should not make assumptions if they are used in this manner , which is diff from their original purpose . none
<user> still extra work to go through . most trolls move on and find new victims . none
<user> last i checked , baldwin was verified . none
<user> you can only have one gv # per acct at any given time . none
<user> only if you want to laugh at how fucking privileged he is . what a tool . none
<user> accepting pull requests for better ideas that do not violate pseudonymity / privacy . < <number> none
<user> i own too many apple products to say that . none
<user> yup <elongated> . jason does not have a lot of experience on twitter , it seems . or a very healthy world view . none
rt <user> : everything wrong with everything in a single screenshot <url> none
<user> if you only want <number> people to use it . none
<user> i am <allcaps> foss </allcaps> at heart . i think the tools should be open for all to use . however , for monitoring services , things that require infra none
<user> it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going , and to pay for the dev work . ideally , this is <percent> crowd - funded . none
<user> this is more from a consumer side , though . from a business side ? one could see email <allcaps> spam </allcaps> as falling under that category . none
<user> and businesses often pay for solutions like that . i have no problem charging businesses , just individuals . none
<user> multiple gmail accts . this is all a lot of effort , though . most trolls just pick a new target . none
<user> nothing will ever be perfect , but this is a good start towards fixing a <allcaps> huge </allcaps> percentage of harassment . none
<user> yeah <elongated> . they were operating a loss until facebook bought them . fbook did not buy them to make money off the service . none
<user> it was to get the userbase . and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data . none
<user> twitter allows <number> yr olds . <number> yr olds do not generally have bank accts . lots <emphasis> of people do not have bank accts / work in cash . none
<user> <money> may not seem that far out of reach to a lot of people in the us , but we are also far removed from the class it would impact . none
<user> <percent> of his points are bullshit taken from white cis male standpoint . no harassment on fbook ? pft . providing id / addy ? <allcaps> nope </allcaps> . none
<user> the client / web experience being similar are key . i do not know if twitter client has the additional controls verified accts have none
<user> i would not do that . none
<user> <user> what are you talking about ? none
<user> <user> i read it only because i already knew what it was going to say . he ' s not a creative thinker . none
<user> <user> he ' s regurgitating the same ideas that people have had before . they were bad then , shockingly , still bad now . none
<user> <user> they do not do this right now . i mean , unless you are becoming verified . none
<user> i met with them weeks ago . <tong> who knows what they might do ? i certainly do not . but we are talking . none
<user> <user> it sets a bad precedent . none
<user> <user> as a guess , anyways . none
oh god . i am so stubborn . just realized the only thing it took to push me off the fence in the real name / pseudonym debate was jason / wadhwa . none
<user> <user> it is rather funny how all of us are so completely different , yet complement each other ' s skill sets so well . none

why do dudes have to play the " you are not serious , just wanting to fight " card when women call them out on solutions with ill consequences ? none
given that he already used his low twitter userid to brag about his worth , i should not be shocked that he wants twitter to be classist . none

it's tough deciding how much of my personal story to relate when giving a short keynote about the present state of anti - harassment efforts . none
i have seen support from places i did not expect when i originally posted my story " still here " , and i think that's important to point out . none
we mostly hear about harassment in the context of gamergate , but that's a very narrow focus and not the real problem . none
<user> i find more impactful talks are based around a story , but it's a tough balance . none
woman dev audience . i think the real msg i want to get across is that anyone can make a difference . even with just a <number> line perl script . none

<user> why would you do that ? <tong> these lectures are about freebsd . none
<user> uh . none
someday , a gater will have an epiphany regarding the definitions for dos / ddos . this unbelievable feat will be a sign of the apocalypse . none
i do not understand why a simple technical definition is giving them so much of a problem . they seem to think dos / ddos = = excessive packets . none
dos / ddos does not refer to a technique or method of transport . it's largely defined by intention + end result . this is not rocket surgery . none
if you want , you can classify an influx of notifications ( dogpile ! ) as unintentional ddos , as it makes core functionality unusable to you . none
it's super common to run into an unintentional dos , especially in dev . ever make a stupid mistake that caused a critical lack of resources ? none
maybe your program forked until it could fork no longer , and you did not have restrictions on . maybe you sent an inappropriate amount of <allcaps> udp </allcaps> . none
will the dev that has never forgotten to put in sleep statements or increment counters or wrote a poorly designed loop please stand up ? none
<user> there ' s no hard definition of what constitutes dos beyond lack of service . service is open to mean many things . none

<user> pravana blue - <allcaps> not </allcaps> pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear . i swear by it . none

it's pretty funny that gamergate thinks i am profiting from harassment . i took a huge <emphasis> pay cut by going full time with this . <user> none

it is weird that someone from gamergate would be opposed to a video * not specific to gamergate * talking about harassment . so weird , right ? none

i am going to cut in here - despite blocking you - to explain something that seems to confuse many people . <user> none
this is a criminal case , not a civil case . this means that it's up to the police to decide if it's worth prosecuting . <user> none
while you can hire a lawyer to help you speak to the police , that's kind of where their - and <allcaps> your </allcaps> - involvement ends . <user> none
if someone has had a crime committed personally against them online , the police are not likely to listen to anyone <allcaps> but </allcaps> them . <user> none
this is not legal advice . but common sense . what i can do is help people know what to say to police or help find a lawyer . <user> none

he ' s said that he ' s backing out , but i think this remains to be seen . however , i am optimistic . none
i have no intent on linking to the articles where he stated he was backing out . they were an attempt to save face , not an apology . none
<user> oh , you have not heard it ? it was amazing . none
<user> oh , gosh . i hope you feel better . <sad> none

i am almost in sniffles at the thought of seeing my freebsd extended family again after so many years . clearly i need more sleep . none

<user> i can not receive tweets in game , only send . <tong> none
<user> <user> <allcaps> i love you nayadri </allcaps> < <number> < <number> < <number> none
the best part about posting to wow forums is that it's only for ppl that have played the game & thus will keep many gaters from descending . none
sometimes i feel like olivia pope . none
ugh . no . i am finally dealing with imposter syndrome . this is not a thing that i am used to having to manage . crap . none
<user> i am pretty familiar with the concept , but not the feeling . ^.^ good read , though . none
<user> i have given a lot of tech talks in the past . this one is not really so technical , more community . <tong> none

<user> <user> who knows . who cares ? just more bullshit they are passing around . i do not pay their claims any attention . none
uh . this is what / angry looks like with undead . it's supposed to be fist in air , not slapping my own butt . <url> none
oh , hell . is blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the wow client ? none
i guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app id . none
i need to think about this . i do not think i like this . none
i think the biggest problem i have with it is that there ' s too much of a reliance on wow services for an external mechanism . none
blizzard has had issues in the past with certain things being delayed ( achievements , d3 ) . i would strongly dislike a tweet being delayed . none
i am still not <percent> certain this is happening . but the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long . none
<allcaps> kiss </allcaps> ( keep it simple , stupid ) very much applies to designing a new feature . if blizzard is proxying tweets , that's unnecessary and bad . none
pickaxe is the new crowbar . <url> none
rt <user> : <hashtag> tweet that shit </hashtag> <url> none
<user> it's basically what we already do in game . <tong> none

<user> <user> the claims she has made are . <repeated> not something someone in their right mind would do . none
<user> <user> she threatened to cut herself if we did not pay her money . none
<user> yeah , this probably is not a good public conversation to have . i just stay away from her . none

<user> want more fun stuff ? google the name of the person i rted . <wink> that music . none
there is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti - harassment . he has defended gamergate in the past . none
at this moment in time , i am unaware of any effort he has made into this space . i am tied inwith many orgs . his name has never once come up . none
he ' s been offered contact info from those he ' s speaking with should he care to contribute . he ' s utilized none of this . i am unimpressed . none
if you are interested in working on solutions , we ' d love to have your help . however , i can spot a flail for media attention from a mile away . none
do not think that it will not go unnoticed / unchallenged . do not put on a cape unless you plan on being a hero . it's not a photo op . it's a job . none
<user> what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion . i am not going to get a pile - on going , so i am not giving specifics . none
since this was questioned , i should be clear . i am not talking about supporters , or just people with opinions . none
i am talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment , but do nothing beyond get rted . none
for everyone that is involved in this space , there ' s a huge personal risk . people get targeted . friends and family get targeted . none
frankly , it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say " i am gonna do stuff ! " and then . <repeated> do nothing . none
or , well , something happened . a hashtag was started by harassers to support him . so , that's something . i guess . none
<user> tbh , i feel bad anytime anyone actively enters this fight without knowing about the personal cost . none
<user> i am not mentioning names for a few different reasons . none
<user> it depends on how you define meaningful . if <number> people listen to you vs 30k , there ' s a huge difference in voice . none
<user> completely disagree . it's industry recognition . none
<user> as someone that went from ~ 4k followers to what i have got now , i have seen a huge difference . none
<user> does not drive , but is in many cases an accurate reflection . none
i bought crepes but i do not really know what they are so i am just going to call this a fruit burrito . <url> none

this thread : <url> - this does not add up . am i missing something ? none
<url> none
rt <user> : <user> <url> none
<user> omg i am dying laughing . none
<user> i am a little concerned . the tweet still exists . i see no retraction published . none
<user> to be clear , i am not bringing this up to defend bri . i am aware that she ' s fully capable of defending herself . none
<user> the use of the word ' bully ' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have . none
<user> given the massive <emphasis> glee i am seeing from gg irt that tweet , it's concerning that he ' s not retracting or explaining ' bully ' none
<user> if i was looking for pitchforks , i ' d point out a white dude in a position of power accused a minority of bullying him . <tong> none
<user> thank you for calling me on this , though . i probably should have made that more clear in the original tweets . none
please no pile - ons . do not tweet at him , etc . i think the conversation is concerning in that we need to discuss what bully means . none

" i honestly do not understand the attacks on this man . " - <user> on <user> . none
did you hear that ? that's the sound of a bunch of women in tech setting up filters to fwd emails from <user> to / dev / null . good job . none
i reached out to <user> with concerns the day the article was published . no response . nina cares more about page views than problems . none
she had her chance to understand , but she ' s decided to dig in her heels . whelp . lesson learned , eh ? none
<user> <user> <user> lol , she was one of the people that gave him a platform and then ignored detractors . none
according to <user> , we should be happy that dudes are talking about feminism . even if they are telling us how we are doing it wrong . none
this is <number> shades of bullshit . wadhwa said that women that disagreed with him were just looking for attention . <allcaps> these were his words </allcaps> . none
if this is an ally , then fuck everything & set the world on fire . <user> was dumb enough to get sucked into his bullshit vortex . none
<user> the thing i said to an account that was a confirmed sockpuppet that was supposed to infiltrate sjws ? lol . none
<user> go fuck yourself . < <number> none
<user> uh . because one group is literally killing people ? are you nuts ? none
rt <user> : <user> one thing that bothers me about it is the fact that despite hundreds of women writing on the subject , a man beco  none
<user> <user> who are you referring to with ' we ' ? none
i have also been told that some of the people mentioned in <user> ' s article did not even talk to her . she quoted them without asking . none
which is fine , i guess . but she went out of her way to talk to wadhwa . interesting , no ? none
<user> yes . given that one group routinely posts mutilated bodies on twitter along with american passports , i ' d say they are worse . none
<user> and i could not give less fucks about alienating followers by giving them an opinion they do not like . none
<user> <user> <user> i am calling her dumb because she fell for his bullshit and also quoted one of the women he abused . none
. <user> twitter search for my name and " set yourself on fire " and see if i give two shits about what you think . none
<user> <user> it was up on 8 chan . someone probably has an archive somewhere . none
rt <user> : <user> why is there a double standard with terrorists from <hashtag> isis </hashtag> being prosecuted quickly while harassers of <hashtag> gamer ga </hashtag>  none
omg twitter you are killing me with dumb this morning . none
rt <user> : <user> you just lost <money> from crowd funding of your cause . choose your battles . none
sorry , i am not going to say gamergate is the same as <allcaps> isis </allcaps> , and you can shove your donation up your ass . <user> none
i do not change my views to get money . that's not how this works . <user> none
<user> he also makes claims of racism if someone calls him on repeatedly using feminist terms incorrectly . i . do not . care . none
<user> this is what you just said . you just compared online harassment to mutilated bodies . this is demeaning . none
. <user> online harassment is a serious problem , and it needs to be addressed . but making false equivalencies will not get you anywhere . none
let me make this super fucking clear . i will not compromise my beliefs in any way just to get donations . that is not happening , ever . none
i appreciate every donation received . but ppl that threaten to pull funding if i do not say the things they want to hear can fuck themselves . none
<user> <user> holy shit . seriously ? i have done research into both groups . i have seen the tweets & patterns . gamergate is not <allcaps> isis </allcaps> . none
no one said threats were not serious . however , there ' s a difference between <allcaps> isis </allcaps> and gamergate . <user> none
you are not going to get the response you are looking for . give up . <user> none
rt <user> : <user> the threats are either serious or they are not . i guess you do not view <hashtag> gamer gate </hashtag> as emotional terrorism . none
<user> yeah . none
<user> why do you think that you know more about the abuse i personally receive than i do ? none
<user> you made a false equivalency , i called it on you , and you threatened financial consequences . none
<user> i mean this from the bottom of my heart : go fuck yourself . none
sweetie , you wandered into my mentions threatening me with financial consequences . this is not bullying . it's backbone . <user> none
something is seriously going down . see <allcaps> lrt </allcaps> of <user> . gg is pushing a weird narrative . none

<user> <user> uh . you came to me with financial threats . none
<user> <user> when you are an asshole in someone ' s mentions and they react , it's not bullying . none
<user> <user> i do not think you understand what bullying or harassment is at all . none
<user> <user> but protip , you will never have the freedom to wander around being a jerk without consequence . none
<user> <user> no . i asked if you were nuts . none

another example of comments that female <allcaps> foss </allcaps> devs get on a regular basis . do not like her code ? insult her appearance ! <url> none

female devs make me uncomfortable , so let us imply her work was a single commit . <url> none
not only that , but this rocket surgeon apparently does not understand the difference between comments and man pages . is not he precious ? none
this is not just gamergate this is not just gamergate this is not just gamergate this is a more obvious version of what already happens none

twitter updates user safety features : <url> none
my take on twitter ' s safety update : propaganda . does not give clear info on what these new actions are . none
until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry , these are just words that mean little . none
the developer policy needs an update that allows us to filter non - promoted tweets . twitter clients continue to have bugswith large block lists none
i am optimistic . this is not the end game . twitter ' s announcement was a single step in a long path in mitigating abuse problems . none
<user> <user> <user> <user> laid off , along with a whole game team . < <number> none
<url> is a good option , but it's a partial solution . we need the ability to filter accts without phone number attached . none
<user> most abuse comes from gamergate accounts that are <number> - <number> days old . none

so , <user> claims that only people new to the industry claim sexism exists . yawn . i am a <number> + year engineer . try again . none
it's easy to think that our experiences are indicative of everyone ' s experiences . i have fallen victim to that thinking before . none
unfortunately , a positive experience does not cancel out a negative . and playing the " cool girl " game is not a good look for anyone . none
rt <user> : <user> <user> yep , <number> + year engineer here , can confirm . none

<allcaps> fygm </allcaps> culture is a real issue . like , " i fought my way here , and it sucked , but i am strong . if you can not do this , it's your problem . " none
<allcaps> fygm </allcaps> culture is a complete lack of empathy . i fought my way here , sure . do i think anyone else should have to do that ? hell , no . none
<allcaps> fygm </allcaps> is keeping the status quo so you can feel some kind of superiority over the women that opted not to put up with the abuse . none
instead of perpetuating <allcaps> fygm </allcaps> culture , why not try to fix things ? why not try to remove some of the hurdles ? would that be so bad , really ? none
if us women in tech are strong enough to get this far , why are not we strong enough to mentor , to push for change ? no more <allcaps> fygm </allcaps> . none

aw , gamergate harassment squad . did i say something to make you mad ? <url> none
oh , i see . it's <user> sending her little harassment squad after me . like we can not see right through her innocent act . none
there ' s a reason we started tracking all of her followers . an immense amount of racism / sexism / abuse was coming from her corner . none
the thing is , you do not actually have to say any of that stuff for us to figure out who it's coming from . it's easy to track social groups . none
so she can try & claim innocence , but statistics paint her as being someone to avoid . and i have been in her sights for a while . oh well . none
rt <user> : <user> ignore fools . embrace the term " bitch " . it means you have strength and express your own opinions . " bitch " is  none
i do not usually like pointing out individual names unless they have gone above and beyond in attempts to hurt people . none
like when <user> said that only industry newbies believed sexism existed . or when <user> sends her harassment squad after ppl . none
i have been watching jenn for a while , deciding if it was worth saying anything . her tweets are benign , but the response <emphasis> is not . none
how should i even classify this ? wielding a mob ? indirect bullying ? i am not sure . none

that moment when i think that i am out of coffee . <repeated> then pull <number> oz of ground arabica out of my backpack . yes ! more glory to the coffee gods . none
<user> <user> <user> <user> <user> confirmed , seeing the same thing in web <emphasis> . none
my fav part of skimming gg tweets is seeing so many people insist that they are unable to develop their views with experience . none
ie : they will still feel this way in <number> years . lol <elongated> . none
they also love to add <number> years to my age . which does not bother me . i grew up envious of <allcaps> unix </allcaps> beards . none
this is coming from the same group that claimed i faked my linkedin because it was " impossible " for a <number> yr old to have done all of that . none
this might be my favorite tweet by rogue , ever . <url> because he assumes my twitter handle is my <allcaps> unix </allcaps> login . none
<allcaps> unix </allcaps> logins are restricted to <number> characters , darling . freebsd uses <allcaps> svn </allcaps> , not git . i believe <allcaps> svn </allcaps> history is imported to github . none
and then there ' s this person , who suggests pc - <allcaps> bsd </allcaps> because freebsd are all sjws . <url> none
pc - <allcaps> bsd </allcaps> is a fork that is mostly funded by ixsystems , the organization that runs freebsd marketing . it's a frontend on top of freebsd . none
all that collusion in the <allcaps> bsd </allcaps> community sure is hard to keep track of . none
in short , this is the most hilarious gamergate <allcaps> bsd </allcaps> fail i have ever seen . <hashtag> free bsd </hashtag> <hashtag> open bsd </hashtag> <hashtag> pcbsd </hashtag> <url> none
btw , guys . i am an admin of the openbsd facebook group . so , you know . <allcaps> collusion </allcaps> . none
rt <user> : <user> wait until they find out the bsds share patches and fixes . none
oh , yeah . and freebsd is the os that runs on your playstations . why so salty ? none
<user> he expects unix logins to map to github usernames - which they rarely will . none
<user> i would put cash money on them not understanding your profile pic . none
<user> i can prove that my code is in freebsd . and there are articles that state that freebsd is running on the ps3 and ps4 . none
<user> for some parts of the company , yes . a lot of freebsd devs work there . none
<user> yup . ^.^ unless it's your field , it's not surprising that you would not know . none
<user> they searched for my * twitter name * in freebsd ' s github <emphasis> none

<user> <user> to be fair , most of my activity happened under my own commit bit . none
<user> <user> but rogue is not really . <repeated> dev competent . he thinks all dev happens under github . none
watching other <allcaps> bsd </allcaps> devs tell roguestar he ' s wrong and it is delicious . none
<allcaps> bsd </allcaps> is a good community . wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking . none
so , just to save you all some time , <allcaps> bsd </allcaps> is my family . the only negative response gg ever received was from a non - dev . none
i have never felt more supported and safe than i do around the freebsd developer community . they are amazing , and i love them . none
the smear tactics are not going to work . these people have known me for over a decade . none
so far , the primary response i have heard from the freebsd dev community in regards to all of this is " how can we help ? " none
and i have asked them to stay uninvolved . but attacking my work with them ? <allcaps> glhf </allcaps> . you are bringing it on yourself . none
it's been several years since i have contributed code . this was due to a conflict with an employer . i asked <emphasis> for my commit bit to be retired . none
but all of these attacks of " not enough commits " or " had a dude do it for you " or " slept with people " proves my point . thanks for that . none
<user> <user> i think i got mine because no one else wanted to touch the code i was working with . <happy> none

rt <user> : <user> gamergate do u even github <url> none
<user> <user> <user> not entirely accurate . if you run strings through / bin , you will find freebsd committer names of recent years . none
<user> <user> <user> you are thinking kernel , not userland . quite a bit of recent ( ish ) freebsd userland exists in osx . none
omg watching freebsd committers just rail at gamergaters for doubting my freebsd contributions none

a bunch of people poked me about some article that was written . eh . i do not really care that much . none
i gave it a <number> second glance , did not see anything interesting . getting mad about that is like raging at a livejournal post . same quality . none
i only really have the time to respond to mainstream media . reviewing everything that gg writes about me would be too time consuming . none
at least <allcaps> msm </allcaps> manages to do basic fact checking , like not confusing <user> with <user> <tong> none
<user> you know this is like the only time a dude ' s code was ever incorrectly attributed to a chick , ever . <tong> none
morning news included a story about twitter safety shutting down <allcaps> isis </allcaps> accounts because they threatened <user> . none
i am not at <allcaps> gdc </allcaps> today , but i will be there tomorrow . <wink> none
well , to be more accurate , i will be dropping by tomorrow during lunch . hit me up if you want to say hi . <laugh> none
<user> i believe so . should be a client - side option ( blocks processing happens client side as well ) none
<user> that's fine . ^.^ none
had to put off press photog until today . now i am back to frantically cleaning & cursing myself for not having time for a haircut . none
watching gamergate mock women that are concerned about appearing at <allcaps> gdc </allcaps> given the threats they have been inundated withoutver the past <number> months . none
perpetuating a culture where abuse is tolerated and targets of abuse are mocked for speaking out against their abusers . none
gamergate is an intimidation mob . speak up ? get threats & dog - piled . speak about the threats ? get mocked & dog - piled . none
<user> <user> <user> i have got this person blocked , please remove me from the conversation . < <number> none
<user> <user> i am not giving a talk . <wink> none
uber just reported hackers broke into their database . this happened last may . timely reporting . none
<user> i ' d be down for this . none
downside of using <user> is that i have to create a new twitter account for each block list . none
rt <user> : checked the <hashtag> gdc2015 </hashtag> tag with & without <user> in place . like night & day . guess which led to more productive tweets  none
<user> meh . <tong> thanks for the heads up , but not too concerned about another angry dude on twitter . none
<user> this is the same dude that thinks that not being allowed to publish an article to a site he does not own is " silencing " none
<user> so his opinion on being blocked on twitter is probably fairly predictable . none
<user> he was already given my email a while ago by someone else . none
i like watching logs . <url> none
what's a decent ror on <number> ( k ) s ? i have averaged <percent> over the past few years . not sure if that's decent or not . none
<user> yeah , that's including fees . fees were not too bad . none
<user> yah . mgt fund fees are pretty low . ~ <money> / year . none
if i do not like who you are following , i block you . if gg does not like who you are following , they go after your job . <url> none
bonus points in this thread . unreal . harassment from gamergate did make abuse more of a topic , i suppose . <url> none
<user> beats me . i was sent the screencap . none
it's human to react negatively to abuse . trying to blame someone for reacting to abuse is , unsurprisingly , a tactic of serial abusers . none
rt <user> : <user> how dare you have feelings is a fantastic way to dehumanize someone . none
this is commonly found in cases of domestic violence , but it's a favored tactic of gamergate as well . none
it's another form of abuse , but more insidious , because the perpetrators think they are the heroes of this story . none
stand strong . the only comfort i have to give right now is that no one is really listening to this particular group , anyways . none
<user> ick . dv can happen to anyone . <annoyed> none

not sure about a stream , but i will have at the very least a vine of zoe making the announcement . and i will be livetweeting . none
<user> <user> <user> file a report with twitter . if it's urgent or twitter ' s abuse system does not do anything , email me . none
i am going to lug my macbook air , my ipad , my 3 ds , and my surface pro <number> with me . i need my battle station . this will suffice . none
<user> my budget is tiny . <happy> i just got an ipad . it was a big expense for me . none
<user> <user> <user> will need a uh , sales contact there . for a specific thing . <repeated> can not release info until ~ <time> . none

<user> <user> i do not think i am going to be able to record , so if you could & post to twitter , that would be awesome . none
listening to <user> talk about how harassment is important . and how we are going to help you through it . none
" i am bringing it up for one reason . gamergate has brought harassment into the limelight , but rest assured , it's always there . " none
this is a problem that affects everyone , but we have seen far more harassment targeting women . none
it is fitting that we are now seeing these strong women speaking out and trying to fix problems that others are uncertain of how to tackle . none
oh gosh she mentioned me and <hashtag> gg autoblocker </hashtag> in her talk and now i am blushing and trying not to sniffle . none
in this ongoing tragedy , we found our voices & each other . we have learned to work together , and to support & encourage these amazing women . none
i can not even find the words to describe how much i value the work of all the people i have met during this time . how much i love all of them . none
we talk about gamergate a lot . but the truth is , gamergate is not the real battle . it's a symptom of a larger problem . none
online harassment is something most people have faced at some point , regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism . none
it's a really tough problem , because it's a <allcaps> big </allcaps> problem . it is far reaching . it has many different forms . none
the scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it . often this leads to thinking , " what can i do ? i am just one person . " none
you are not just one person . there are many of us , and we all have voices . but more than that , we have resources , experience , and passion . none
you are not alone in this . you are never alone in this . none
we have seen so many fantastic things happen out of this tragedy . first , we have <user> . amazing advocacy . a voice that is far reaching . none
we have <user> , an invaluable resource that provides emotional support for targets of harassment . none
both of these organizations have been created to address different aspects of very real problems that affect all of us . none
it's almost time . <happy> none

rt <user> : how blizzard is taking aim at toxic players in heroes of the storm : <url> <url> none
i like the way blizzard is tackling toxic players in heroes of the storm . it's a good first step . none
creating a reporting system is difficult , because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved . none
for more egregious cases for harassment , we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately . but most toxicity is not this . none
having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse , so we need to tackle this head on . none
putting the tools into the hands of users is a <allcaps> great </allcaps> idea . we need more active solutions for protecting ourselves . none
one of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human . we can do better . none
<user> the only info i have got is the kotaku article i just rted . <happy> none
gaming companies are rarely tech <emphasis> companies . that's not their core competency , but they deal with inordinate amounts of abuse . none
<user> difficult to write those with current limitations of developer policy . none
users want transparency in abuse systems , but there ' s a difficulty in this . it can allow people to game the system . none
<user> <allcaps> gdc </allcaps> has been amazing . we have been waiting for this . none

<user> most of tech does not really know about gamergate and does not care . in a bigger sense , gamergate has no importance . none
<user> that's why they really can not effect us . gaming industry is involved , sure . but it's a much bigger conversation . none

<user> <user> no worries . the whole " you scare easily " is seriously the most hilarious thing i have seen all day . none
<user> <user> people confuse empathy with being scared , and that says more about them than anything . none
things i am scared of : small red lights in dark rooms . drive through carwashes . large spiders . not being able to afford blackmilk . none

that's why we have <user> . because going on the internet without fearing for your life should be a basic human right . none
combating online harassment does not mean jerks will not exist . everyone is a jerk , sometimes . but you should not ever be afraid . none
online harassment takes many forms . some is actionable , by the service provider ( tos ) or law enforcement . none
we seek to help clarify those policies and gain better enforcement , as well as provide users with the power to filter what they experience . none
<user> never feel bad about that . it's pretty intense if you are not prepared for it . none
<user> it takes a pretty specific personality type to be able to take this shit on voluntarily . none
there ' s no one - size - fits - all answer for online harassment . but we are in this for the long haul . we have got ideas . we will help . none
<user> i went through that my first night talking about gg when baldwin started tweeting at me . good lord . that was a bit intimidating . none
we are already privately working with a number of tech companies . relationships are being built . we are making <allcaps> huge </allcaps> amounts of progress . none
i can not wait until we are in a position to be able to share more details , but not yet . it's early days . none
if your company has an abuse , social media , or community team , we want to talk . all industries welcome . <email> none
