@ummayman90 If god is protecting his Islam, why does he need you to protect it, murder apostates, and spread his vile religion by sword. 2941145694 racism

@ummayman90 Who knows if they criticized him?  He killed them.  And the things against him would never make it into the Sunnah. 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 When people leave Islam, they don't announce it.  They just quietly walk away. 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 The only reason the overall numbers increase is because Muslims breed like rats, just like their prophet told them to do. #Islam 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 And Muslims are expected to fear god as well.  If living in fear is your idea of perfect, you are stupid. 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 It's not about who was not murdered by him, it's about who was. 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 Because they breed like rats, kill non Muslims, and force religion on people by the sword. 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 Yes, might, power, and imperialism is what it is all about.  There is zero spirituality in it.  Soon the world will understand. 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 No, you know damn well that Mohammed told his followers to breed as a source of population imperialism. #Islam 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 As a percentage there are very few. And they are usually poor women who marry a Muslim man. There is nothing persuasive in Islam 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 Only an idiot would think that god wants to be feared. Muslims cannot think beyond the characteristics of an earthly tyrant. 2941145694 racism
@ummayman90 Again, your entire concept of god corresponds to a tyrannical earthly egomaniac because you are simple and stupid. #Islam 2941145694 racism

@_enzk @SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch The mess was there long before the US. The entire history of Islam is murder http://t.co/n0oXQ2kkUb 2941145694 racism
@_enzk @SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch And today the huge majority of death in Islamic states are done by Muslims. 2941145694 racism
@_enzk @SumbelinaZ @IronmanL1 @Hatewatch For example, 80% of all civilians killed in Afghanistan are killed by Taliban. 2941145694 racism
@meghan_hurley Islam is a good place for criminals to find a home. 2941145694 racism
@NNdabbour64 A religion that declares war on humanity has no respect for anyone and is hypocritical to ask for respect. 2941145694 racism
@NNdabbour64 Every Muslim who is forced to stay in Islam by the law of apostacy for murder is forced. 2941145694 racism
@NNdabbour64 Every child that is brainwashed and never given a choice is force. 2941145694 racism
@NNdabbour64 All the Christians and Ezidis that are told to leave or convert or die are forced. 2941145694 racism
@NNdabbour64 And all the hatred was started by your pedophile prophet.  Now you are finally getting it back. http://t.co/L8VgSNBDQX 2941145694 racism

@NNdabbour64 I am better. I have no problem with Hinduism, Christianity, Tao, Judaism, Buddhism or atheism. But Islam hates all non-Muslims. 2941145694 racism
@NNdabbour64 Yes, people can believe what they want. But Islam doesn't give them that choice. 2941145694 racism
@NNdabbour64 And no one is entitled to a belief that denies other people their believes. http://t.co/pli8wePBsf 2941145694 racism

@obsurfer84 Wrong Jewish tribe microbrain.  The Jews of Khybar had nothing to do with Mohammed. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 They welcomed Islam with a sword at their throats. There was nothing kind about Islam. It was a religion designed for thugs. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 You claim to be anti religion, yet you spend all your time lying for the benefit of Islam, the religion of hate. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 @teenage Let people read the Quran and see that it comes from hate. http://t.co/cuQDA0n32q 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 @teenage Let people look at the polls that Muslims answered and see that they come from hate. http://t.co/j2BAMNBzi4 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 @teenage It's a guide for nothing. It's Islam's claims of the laws of god.  And Islam's god is a terrorist. Islam's prophet too. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 @teenage Yes, you can lie about Islam all you want and you can deny all the evidence all you want.  No one cares about opinion. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 @teenage You can blab endlessly about love, but you defend a religion of hate - which is the action of a hater, namely you. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 Mohammed's excuse in every aggression is, "I had to attack because I heard they were going to attack". 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 But the truth is that Mohammed followers were worthless starving thugs that produced nothing and so wanted the riches of Khybar. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 And today many Muslims are still worthless thugs that produce nothing. They are either rescued by oil money or try to steal. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 Even your own link shows that the Jews were the producers and the Muslims lived by stealing others property. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 Then, when there was no one left to rob, the Muslims returned to being dessert Bedouins still trying to rob each other. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 99% of all inventions come from the west. Islam has produced nothing in 1000 years. Mohammed was an illiterate who produced nada 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 The few things Islam came up with were from conquered people and came in spite of Islam, not because of it. 2941145694 racism
@obsurfer84 The ME led the world in development before there was Islam and fell behind the world after Islam. 2941145694 racism

@scamp_faridxx @AbuAlbaraaSham Islam declared war on all humanity 1400 years ago, so talking about murderers of Muslims is total hypocrisy. 2941145694 racism
Islam is simply an excuse to rape, murder, loot, practice bigotry, sexism and hatred. The prophet Mohamed designed it to get thugs to follow 2941145694 racism
With it's jihad cornerstone, Islam is a religion that was designed for those that would rather loot and rape for a living than work. 2941145694 racism

@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Islam is the most decisive, hatefilled, backward thing that has ever happened to mankind. 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Every day we get the results of the hatred bred by Islam. http://t.co/FafjRPlI6t 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Every day we see that Muslims hate freedom, democracy, justice. http://t.co/tDgsfthA4h 2941145694 racism

@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime You only have to count the corpses to see that Islamic extremism is widespread.Jewish not 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Muslims rape and enslave 3000 Ezidi women who did nothing and you give me this? 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Did they should "God is Great"? Did they burn them in a cage? 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime You are comparing a few thousand Jewish extremists with a few million  Muslim extremists. 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Because most of them are Muslims and most are impoverished. 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime And while Christianity moved past it's barbarity, Islam keeps returning to it. 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Yes, unlike the gulf Muslim countries where they still behead and won't let women drive. 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Since Muslims are sworn to exterminate them, why shouldn't they. 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime And west killed the guy who killed the 6 million Jews. In Muslim world, Hitler was hero. 2941145694 racism

@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime Yes, there is even more rape in Muslim countries but it is not reported. 2941145694 racism
@Qoloob4 @Vandaliser @sajid_fairooz @IsraeliRegime If a raped woman doesn't have four witnesses she will be punished further under Islam. 2941145694 racism

@discerningmumin Yes, the western world was unaware of the layer of Islamolunatics that lived under the thumbs of the dictators. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin And that meant that once the dictators were gone, the Islamolunatics would try to disrupt democracy with violence. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Unfortunately, real Islam, as defined in the Quran and Hadith, is too backwards and inhuman even for most ME Muslims. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin And since Islam declared war on all humanity. Humanity must return the favor and declare war on Islam. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin What are you talking about provocation? Islam declared war with the world.  That is more than enough provocation. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin How many Muslims there are is irrelevant. The declaration of war on mankind is clearly spelled out in Quran and Hadiths. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin It's Muslims that do virtually all the killing.  For example, 80% of civilians killed in Afghanistan are killed by Taliban. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Hamas was elected once and have not had elections since.They have skipped many elections. Mursi was going in same direction 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin And if Muslims are angry that they can't force Islam on people, who cares? http://t.co/G43tlj1dGU 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Wrong. Apostacy is the equivalent of leaving America and becoming a citizen of another country. There is no penalty. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin The hypocrisy of Islam is that they expect to convert people from other religions but they murder converts from their own. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin And furthermore, they murder anyone who tries to convert a Muslim, but demand the freedom to convert non Muslims. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Islam is an entire religion built on intolerance and jihad. It's time for the world to stop tolerating it. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Actually, Muslims enslaved far more than anyone else. The prophet Mohammed was a slave trader. Jesus had no slaves. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Furthermore, the Muslims were the last to give up slavery, and many only did it under pressure from the west. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin But the western world gave up slavery on it's own. No one forced them from the outside. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin And now, every Jihadi group wants to reinstate slavery in the present because the Quran approves it and Mohammed practiced. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin So if you are against slavery, you cannot be a Muslim. So why are you crying about slavery when the Quran approves it? 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin The first slaughterers were the Muslims. They invaded the Christian world 400 years before the crusades. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin The Muslims conquered 2/3 of the Christian world before it attacked back. So again, what are you crying about. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin The Muslims also invaded India and murdered 80 million Hindus. They virtually exterminated all Buddhist on in India. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin The Muslims attacked and murdered the Zoastrians in Persia and the Buddhists in Afghanistan. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin No minorities of any kind are left in Saudi and several other gulf states, having been exterminated by Muslims. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Now Muslim terror groups are trying to complete the job of killing or throwing out any remaining minority groups in Arabia. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Islam is the most genocidal religion on the planet.  Mankind must exterminate Islam or be exterminated by it. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Because while other groups can evolve, the violence of the Quran and Hadith prevent Islam from ever being a human religion. 2941145694 racism
@raqqa_mcr The lesson the world learned about Islam is that when we get rid of their brutal dictators, they are replaced by brutal Islamists 2941145694 racism

@AlalamChannel ISIS continues their big successes against unarmed civilians. They just can't win a fight against anything but families. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Mohammed owned 28 slaves. So if you are against slavery you are against Mohammed. Otherwise you are just bull shiting. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin But your whole conversation about slavery is phony bull shit propaganda since you follow a slave owner prophet. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Good. We have established that Muslims are slavers and that their humanity has failed to evolve past slave owning. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin By practicing Islam you are vomiting on all Jews, Christians and non believers. Check code of Umar. http://t.co/ArxeP7L88p 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin It's not a prophet competition. It's about following a fraud who owned slaves, had people murdered, was a bigot, etc. 2941145694 racism

@discerningmumin Islam has never been a resistance to oppression. It has always been source of oppression to both believers and non believer 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Islam has Hadiths that tell you what hand to use to wipe your ass. There is zero room for individualism in it. 2941145694 racism
@discerningmumin Islam is a slave religion, both for it's followers and for the people it enslaves, and for the dhimmis it rules. 2941145694 racism

@truaemusic @mattybboi83 @Number10gov Islam cannot be reformed because it's vileness is too deep in the religion. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic @mattybboi83 @Number10gov Mohammed was a murderer, Jesus wasn't. Mohammed was a rapist, Jesus wasn't. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic @mattybboi83 @Number10gov Mohammed was a slave trader, Jesus wasn't.  Mohammed was a sexist, Jesus wasn't. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic Mohammed led 17 military expeditions, beheaded 600 Jews in one day, married a six year old girl, etc. etc. Get the picture? 2941145694 racism

@truaemusic And the Christian world got rid of slavery by itself.The Muslim world was pressured into getting rid of it and now returns to it 2941145694 racism

@truaemusic By hating the ideaology that enables it, that is what I'm doing. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic Islam is not a race, microbrain, it is a religion.  You can always tell a leftist, because when he runs out of arguments he... 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic The question is not about people doing bad things, it is about the religion supporting and demanding those things. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic Okay, show me where Buddha or Lao Tse ever hurt anyone or advocated anyone be hurt. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic Buddha said that slavery was unacceptable 1100 years before the slave trader Mohammed came along. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic So if a Buddhist owns a slave you can say that he goes against his religion.  But a Muslim slave owner is not going against his. 2941145694 racism
@truaemusic This means that if you want to establish a humanist ideaology, Islam will get in the way much more than Buddhism. 2941145694 racism

@AMohedin And ISIS does what Islam requires. 33:33 is just the start. 2941145694 racism
@AMohedin Okay, so we understand that the Quran makes striking a woman an option and that the woman must obey the man. 2941145694 racism
@AMohedin Two verses and we can agree that Islam tells women to stay home, cover up, obey your husband, right? 2941145694 racism
@AMohedin My 2:282 says that you can replace the testimony of one man with that of two women. 2941145694 racism
@Wonderstroke Mohammed was suppose to be guided by god, and his example was for all mankind for all time. He was not suppose to follow. 2941145694 racism

@Kaya786 A phobia is an irrational hatred. There is no such thing as a  phobia for a hatred that is rational. 2941145694 racism

@Kaya786 B. The only reason there are non Muslims on the earth is because the non Muslim armies defeated the Muslims. 2941145694 racism
@Kaya786 And it is Islam's preoccupation with violent victory rather than persuasion that makes it globally hated. 2941145694 racism

@roisin_morgan And while all other religious groups globally are under genocidal attacks by Muslims you blame the Jews.  Utterly  stupid. 2941145694 racism
@jncatron No, idiot, Zionism is the determination of Jews to recover a small fraction of the land stolen from them by Muslims. 2941145694 racism

@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ What Christian who is not insane would want to live under Sharia law? 2941145694 racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ Any idiot would know that the expelling of Palestinians would not change the ratio of Christians to Muslims. 2941145694 racism
@dankmtl @PeaceNotHate_ One thing about Muslims, they want to exterminate everyone who is not a Muslim. They are doing it around the world. 2941145694 racism

@dankmtl With the third Jewish tribe he beheaded all the men after they surrendered and sold all the women and children into slavery. 2941145694 racism

@halalflaws @AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm It says women must stay at home and not display themselves. 2941145694 sexism
@AMohedin Again skipping what you don't like. It says that men are in charge of women and men are superior to women. http://t.co/5mAnQbibj1 2941145694 sexism
@AMohedin And at the end it clearly states that beating women is an option if that's what it takes to make her obey. 2941145694 sexism
@AMohedin It doesn't say "mentally beat them". It says, "beat them". You are sugar coating for the kiddies and women. 2941145694 sexism
@AMohedin Being strong physically does not mean strong mentally. The verse clearly says that a husband can force his will on a wife. 2941145694 sexism

@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm And 4:34 tells women that men are superior and that husbands can beat wives 2941145694 sexism
@AMohedin What is it that women lack that requires two women witnesses to replace one man? 2941145694 sexism

Really, tho, I kind of just want to drain a glass of wine and rant about things that I don't like. But I can do that anytime. 13857342 none
Also - I'm thinking that another SJW party may be happening soon. Perhaps after GDC? 13857342 none
@Ruderzz generally, anytime you say "devil's advocate", it means you're wasting people's time and being an ass. especially arguing points 13857342 none
@Ruderzz that no one has contested. it's an old and tiresome trick used by trolls and pseudo-feminists all the time. 13857342 none
@Ruderzz my personal facebook is not ever a place to debate that. ;) i'll unblock, but please don't do that again. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked jfc. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked that person sounds like a moron. i like to find people like that and shit on them. 13857342 none
@Ruderzz no worries. i block quickly from my facebook - the notifications go to my phone (unlike twitter). but always willing to unblock. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked i'm an engineer w/15 yrs exp, and i get mansplained career advice by dudes with 1/2 the xp and bad life decisions. 13857342 none

@girlziplocked @ameliagreenhall i have been raging at him for uh... 5 months? i think? ever since innovating women. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked @ameliagreenhall he didn't worry about me back then. since then, i've been published everywhere. he's trying to discredit. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked @ameliagreenhall i really wish I had the time to dig more into SU - financials and such. Seems basically CxO circlejerk. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked @ameliagreenhall sigh. he accused me of racism... for what, i have no idea. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked whelp. I'm starting to get a pretty decent platform. I'm going to get his face out there, alright. &lt;3 13857342 none
@girlziplocked the anti-abuse thing is my main focus, always. but in my spare time? his bullshit *is* abusive towards feminism. 13857342 none

@girlziplocked it amazes me how he thinks he's helping feminism. by telling women they are doing it wrong. what. 13857342 none
@girlziplocked if he really wanted to ally, he'd get his dudebros to change - not tell women how to "fit in" with dudebros. 13857342 none
I am probably not answering email tonight. I have other work to catch up on. This weekend = = gobs of email. 13857342 none

@korvys @jonrosenberg I had to source *many* gater's timelines. The grammar wasn't good enough for it to work well with just one. seriously 13857342 none

@jonrosenberg my markov bot was also on buzzfeed - it catches a lot of gaters. http://t.co/6NgTAoDzyv 13857342 none
@jonrosenberg they are both pretty entertaining to talk to sometimes. ;) 13857342 none
@jonrosenberg the fight between both of them will keep going until i stop it, or until the script restarts when pulling in a new cache (1d) 13857342 none
@jonrosenberg if you follow, they follow back - and then randomly RT/fav your stuff if they like it. it's weird. 13857342 none

@p8952_ @mjg59 but i've only discussed with other members of targeted harassment from this specific group. can't speak for other hate groups 13857342 none

Disclaimer: None of these things I'm about to tell you are 100% accurate. Just *mostly* accurate. There are always exceptions. 13857342 none
In the past 12 hrs, GG hashtag saw 1018 tweets/hr (776 of which were RTs). Min: 662 (473) Max: 1519 (1233). majority of non-RT came from bot 13857342 none
Tweets which saw the most RTs tend to be questionable, abusive, and almost always aimed at @spacekatgal, @thequinnspiracy, @femfreq, and me. 13857342 none
In the past 12h, @spacekatgal is seeing the most targeted abuse, with 194 (36 OC/158 RT) GG hashtaged tweets mentioning her. Congrats! 13857342 none
This is followed not-so-closely by @femfreq, with 80 (44 OC/36 RT) GG hashtagged tweets mentioning her. Better luck next time. 13857342 none
When we look at all mentions of a username, including RTs, @spacekatgal has received 1611 in the past 12h. @femfreq has received 911. 13857342 none
Can't wait until I get more data on this. But it looks like @spacekatgal should probably avoid her mentions at 8-10AM PDT Sundays. ;) 13857342 none

@Sir5000 hm? 13857342 none
literally #devops 13857342 none
@spacekatgal we could do something fun with this. i could see how many tweets you get from users you've blocked. 13857342 none
The goal here is to eventually have up a pretty dashboard where you can go and see up-to-the-minute stats on this stuff. 13857342 none
I'm starting to get a grasp for when the notification ugliness is going to happen, so it could be an interesting incident notification tool. 13857342 none
however, it doesn't scale. i can use this to track up to a certain number of users. if they target a user i'm not looking at, won't work. 13857342 none
it would be possible with a super low retention for graphs, i guess, and *.wsp files that are deleted if they aren't updated in N minutes? 13857342 none
but that seems gross, and not really how this tool should be used. can do better w/other things, this is more for an overview. 13857342 none
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity wsp is... sigh. but i'm just using docker in aws with a grafana image. fuck configuring this crap. 13857342 none
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i got statsd/graphite working on freebsd once, but then i switched to connected line graphs and it crashed?! 13857342 none
@cheeseplus @obfuscurity i don't wanna devops this. i just want it to work so i can do other things. i need a devops. 13857342 none
@cheeseplus yeah. i'm kind of feeling like for what i'm doing, wsp is ok. for doing more granular monitoring, redis would be good. 13857342 none
@cheeseplus no pretty graphs easily generated out of redis, tho. i'd have to learn R or somesuch. 13857342 none
@Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn oh dear 13857342 none

@Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn looking into it, ty for the headsup. 13857342 none
@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn yeah, i've got a cron to kick it. it must not be kicking it properly. 13857342 none
@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn or it's not responding to kill signals. weeeeird. because i ran the script manually and it worked. 13857342 none
@vex0rian @Sir5000 @StormsOnSaturn getting into inst is slow. it's oomed. prob going to have to aws console and kick it. 13857342 none
@ctmf they are already setting up  bots to tweet with the hashtag to inflate it. i don't really see this making much of a difference. 13857342 none

@GemmaNoon it's what i'm *trying* to do, at least targeting specific groups/causes. it's tricky. have to look more at statistics than words. 13857342 none
@GemmaNoon ie: things not as open for interpretation, such as numeric or boolean data (is following/is not following, etc). 13857342 none
@GemmaNoon it's really fun watching patterns emerge in all of this regarding various groups. i think it'll be useful. 13857342 none
@GemmaNoon rather amused that despite their protests, GG is the only group i've looked at where abuse is easily predicted based on followers 13857342 none
@sschinke @TsundereRager previous versions of ebooks_example (code using twitter_ebooks) wouldn't reply to *_ebooks accounts. 13857342 none

Verified accts for all is an OK idea, but too much administrative overhead. There are better ways, which I've talked about in the past. 13857342 none
verified accounts have features that other accounts do not. not sure what kind of overhead increasing that # would have. 13857342 none
however, twitter clients and web are supposed to have the same tools/exp. that's why devpolicy doesn't really encourage 3rd party clients. 13857342 none
the ability to lock a unique phone # to your account already exists. eng/infra is already there. expose if a # has been added via metadata. 13857342 none
add a filter to toggle showing phone-verified accts in clients (requires devpolicy update, natch). 13857342 none
does have some drawbacks. but a 2nd toggle saying 'show me accts older than N days' is easy. metadata already exists. client/policy update. 13857342 none
phone # idea isn't perfect (it's easy enough to grab a phone # from GV), but it's an extra step - good deterrent for majority of abuse. 13857342 none
in short, there needs to be a verified that isn't Verified. requiring govt ids will cause probs. unique phone less problematic, not perfect. 13857342 none
don't worry, i'm sure no one will be like "WHAT A GREAT IDEA" until a dude takes credit for it. &lt;3 13857342 none
@tomdcc a lot of people don't have cell phones. i was one of them for 2 years. ;) i only used GV. against the idea of disallowing GV. 13857342 none
@tomdcc not everyone can afford cell phones. GV is a good alternative. we don't want to turn twitter into a classist thing. 13857342 none
@dominictarason i was talking to twitter about it a few weeks ago, talked about it here a month ago (neener). :P 13857342 none
@eDRoaCH unaware of their issues. do they not have cell phones/access to GV? 13857342 none
@eDRoaCH i've seen some strong proof that people in the middle east are using online solutions for SMS. 13857342 none
@eDRoaCH @orvtech this isn't de-anonymizing. the phone # wouldn't necessarily be stored. no names would be required. 13857342 none
@tomdcc it's very easy to change your GV #. 13857342 none
it is really not at all surprising to me that wadhwa and jason are both promoting a solution that removes pseudonymity. 13857342 none
pseudonyms are good. own it! anonymous is not the same thing. what jason/wadhwa are promoting would require ID/home address/PAY TO USE 13857342 none
go figure that silicon valley circle jerk elite don't realize that some people can't afford $10/month to not be harassed. 13857342 none
*whispers* hey guys. being free from abuse/harassment doesn't have to be monetized. it should be for everyone. i can show you the way. 13857342 none
take off your VC fedoras and think about what this really is. it's about the right that anyone has to not be harassed &amp; threatened. 13857342 none
so, my yammering sleazeball cupcakes, you can go with http://t.co/TDToqiuQDc and i'll go my way.  I fight for the users. 13857342 none
@teh_maxh you don't have to have a phone to get SMS. you have to have internet. which is also required for twitter. 13857342 none
@eDRoaCH @twitter the number doesn't have to be stored to be ensured unique... 13857342 none
@eDRoaCH @twitter think about how passwords work. are they stored in plaintext? can the provider easily decrypt them? nope. 13857342 none
@tomdcc oh god that sounds like a horrible idea. privacy problems. also, twitter likely wouldn't be storing the number. that would be bad. 13857342 none
i'm still entertained that jason's idea is to either pay a fee or make your acct protected. i'd love to hear his thoughts on short skirts. 13857342 none
@eDRoaCH i think we shouldn't make assumptions if they are used in this manner, which is diff from their original purpose. 13857342 none
@teh_maxh still extra work to go through. most trolls move on and find new victims. 13857342 none
@dylanw last i checked, baldwin was verified. 13857342 none

@Spacekatgal i'm FOSS at heart. i think the tools should be open for all to use. however, for monitoring services, things that require infra 13857342 none
@Spacekatgal it makes sense to ask for donations to keep it up and going, and to pay for the dev work. ideally, this is 100% crowd-funded. 13857342 none
@Spacekatgal this is more from a consumer side, though. from a business side? one could see email SPAM as falling under that category. 13857342 none
@Spacekatgal and businesses often pay for solutions like that. i have no problem charging businesses, just individuals. 13857342 none
@tomdcc multiple gmail accts. this is all a lot of effort, though. most trolls just pick a new target. 13857342 none
@tomdcc nothing will ever be perfect, but this is a good start towards fixing a HUGE percentage of harassment. 13857342 none
@Spacekatgal yeahhhh. they were operating a loss until facebook bought them. fbook didn't buy them to make money off the service. 13857342 none
@Spacekatgal it was to get the userbase. and we all know how fbook loves to do social experiments with data. 13857342 none
@Spacekatgal twitter allows 13 yr olds. 13 yr olds don't generally have bank accts. *lots* of people don't have bank accts/work in cash. 13857342 none

Sometimes I hope that CA does break off and become it's own island. I love it here, but damn. The system is rigged. 13857342 none
CA physically separates from US in a natural disaster. CA decides to separate as a governmental entity as well, proclaiming independence. 13857342 none

A peace treaty is brokered. Google reverts search to include porn and adds a new Google API for Cats as a Service. The world rejoices. 13857342 none

@dylanw i didn't come at this looking to attack him. He's the one that told me to piss off. 13857342 none
@dylanw I'm sorry you don't have any time, that sucks. But next time you might want to look further before useless vague callouts. 13857342 none
@dylanw not publicly, and only to him. that's not an insult. he's the one that referenced it near the top of his blog post. 13857342 none
@dylanw i get that you're probably going to defend your friend regardless, but what he did was shitty, and then you followed it w/more shit. 13857342 none
@dylanw calling me out in that manner was poo-flinging, without any reference of *why*. it was totally useless and provoking. good job. 13857342 none
@dylanw i'm not responsible for his hurt feelings when he's the one that decided to ignore me instead of having a conversation. 13857342 none
@dylanw his behavior - and yours, for that matter - are pretty typical. sorry if the truth hurts. 13857342 none
@dylanw also, from a fellow SJ to another, "butthurt" is generally frowned upon as a descriptor. 13857342 none

@dylanw I don't know him. I don't know if he acts that way with everyone. I only can base my opinion off that single exp &amp; his blog post. 13857342 none

@AgQueue uh. 13857342 none
Someday, a gater will have an epiphany regarding the definitions for DoS/DDoS. This unbelievable feat will be a sign of the apocalypse. 13857342 none
I don't understand why a simple technical definition is giving them so much of a problem. They seem to think DoS/DDoS == excessive packets. 13857342 none
DoS/DDoS doesn't refer to a technique or method of transport.  It's largely defined by intention + end result.  This is not rocket surgery. 13857342 none
if you want, you can classify an influx of notifications (dogpile!) as unintentional DDoS, as it makes core functionality unusable to you. 13857342 none
It's super common to run into an unintentional DoS, especially in dev. Ever make a stupid mistake that caused a critical lack of resources? 13857342 none
Maybe your program forked until it could fork no longer, and you didn't have restrictions on. Maybe you sent an inappropriate amount of UDP. 13857342 none
Will the dev that has never forgotten to put in sleep statements or increment counters or wrote a poorly designed loop please stand up? 13857342 none
@coconono there's no hard definition of what constitutes DoS beyond lack of service. Service is open to mean many things. 13857342 none

@a_man_in_black WELL ACTUALLY I'm kiiiiiiiinda a rainbow haired expert. 13857342 none
@a_man_in_black in all seriousness, i've been dying my hair since my teens. I can't remember the last time I used a single shade. Too flat. 13857342 none
@ElisaRockDoc works well for some colors. the pastels are gorgeous but fade SUPER quickly. the blues are amazing. 13857342 none
@milfgaardian Depends on shade. When doing blues, most MP fades out greyish blue, most SFX fades out w/green tint. 13857342 none
@milfgaardian I usually mix brands depending on how they fade. SFX has fantastic pinks, though. N'Rage does some decent pinks, too. 13857342 none
@a_man_in_black gross. i'd look weird with no hair. 13857342 none
@milfgaardian have you tried pravana? 13857342 none
@milfgaardian pravana blue - NOT pastels - mixed with a touch of purple to make the fade gorgeous + pravana clear. i swear by it. 13857342 none
@milfgaardian it's relatively new. most salons have switched to using it here instead of specialfx. 13857342 none
@milfgaardian (brb, am starting to feel feelings in my scalp, that means it's time to wash this stuff out.) 13857342 none
@milfgaardian not sure. i kind of like when it fades on short hair, if it's dyed well. it's less monotone. 13857342 none
@milfgaardian check it - https://t.co/BCdYXQzAm7 13857342 none
@milfgaardian pravana vivids are my favorite line for blues, easily. pastels line is gorgeous, but fades SO quick. days to weeks. 13857342 none
@milfgaardian pravana pastel pink fade after 14 days. the rest was originally mint colored. COMPLETELY GONE. http://t.co/V2UqO3Male 13857342 none

It is weird that someone from GamerGate would be opposed to a video *not specific to GamerGate* talking about harassment. So weird, right? 13857342 none
I mean, why would GamerGate care about a video where people read the abusive tweets they've received? What does this have to do with ethics? 13857342 none

Then q&amp;a for both of us keynote speakers got hijacked to show harassment happening live. Both of us talked about diff aspects of harassment. 13857342 none
Talked about the need for support, mentors. People that understand because they've been through it all, too. 13857342 none
I was blown away. I couldn't even think of a more impactful way of getting across the point that this is a problem we need to talk about. 13857342 none

She's friends with weev, an actual neo-nazi that has harassed and driven women like Kathy Sierra out of the industry. 13857342 none
She's trying to play it as "we can have our own opinions but I still respect you" - No. She doesn't. She admitted that she was selling out. 13857342 none
She also claimed that women being angry with Wadhwa was worse than the death threats we were getting because we're "used to it". 13857342 none

@caulkthewagon sorry. didn't realize i wasn't allowed to joke about the weather. o_O 13857342 none

@shereeny @caulkthewagon which she totally would have gotten had she not continued to rant about me publicly after I said I didn't know. 13857342 none
@shereeny @caulkthewagon instead, she got a block. Because I'm used to having people shitting all over my mentions. And that's a shame. 13857342 none
@shereeny @caulkthewagon she assumed I was *lying* when I said I didn't know, and that's ridiculous. I've been busy the past week. 13857342 none

Auto-dimming display is nice. Not sure about battery life. Feels a tiny bit more responsive, but not sure if just wishing it was faster. 13857342 none
Texture is different from paperwhite. More matte? I kind of like paperwhite more. More concerned about dropping this one. Get a case. 13857342 none
@alanpdx yeah, i've got around ~1k books. 13857342 none
@TimCField supposedly battery life &amp; auto-dimming display? 13857342 none

@DataFran yeah, i've dropped paperwhite tons of times on my hardwood floors, no problems. Voyage I'm more concerned about. 13857342 none
@planethalia Yeah, I use calibre. It's how I sort between kindles. 13857342 none
@aeliasen I think the paperwhite would be a better choice. voyage has weird delays sometimes with button responsiveness. 13857342 none
@aeliasen fire is still least finicky/most responsive of all, though. I've had for a few years, it holds up well to abuse. 13857342 none
@aeliasen If I was watching streaming video, battery life was just OK. But reading books, it would last quite a while. 13857342 none

LOLOL THE FIRST THING HE SAYS 13857342 none
Oh my god. 13857342 none
"On twitter, you don't know who you are talking to." - oh, this woman couldn't be a software dev. oh lordy. 13857342 none
"Thanks to you, now people are attacking me on twitter" - uh, well, actually, we hated what you were doing before NPR aired this episode. 13857342 none
"these are women not on social media. these are women not like the ones you are interviewing." - because women on social media aren't real. 13857342 none
"They don't relate to these women on social media. these activists, these feminists. they don't relate to them. they are more humble." 13857342 none
all of these quotes are from @wadhwa on @tldr. 13857342 none
sorry i'm not humble, dick. 13857342 none
@thelindsayellis @WNYC listen to the latest episode. it's all explained. 13857342 none
"kelly, i'm really disappointed in you" - can disappointed wadhwa be a meme? 13857342 none
"i don't need this money, frankly" - wait, what money? wadhwa said all the proceeds were going to women &amp; he didn't take money for speaking. 13857342 none
"i encourage your bosses to listen to what you just said" - oh. let's appeal to the male authority, right? 13857342 none
meredith - "mr wadhwa, i would love to broadcast this entire interview the way it is."  DEAD SILENCE FROM WADHWA. 13857342 none
"ally in social media is a slang word. my slang is not good." oh, here come allegations of racism. countdown. 13857342 none
@MetroidThief about halfway through. 13857342 none
wadhwa is now blaming npr for bad health. 13857342 none
"[women] don't understand how journalism works. that i have given women a platform." 13857342 none
"i understand that some women are angry at me, but they [...] don't understand how journalism works." uh, hi. i'm in newsweek, too. 13857342 none

A lot of women in tech have had to commit themselves so utterly to their work in order to be taken seriously. He's denying their identity. 13857342 none

Can't believe he did that AGAIN. Jesus. Hey dudes? Don't do that. Not ever. Ask yourself, would I do this to a guy? No? Then fucking STOP. 13857342 none
Being shamed for past relationships is one of the many bullshit things dudes do to silence women. Especially women in tech. 13857342 none

@dsmyxe @PolitiBunny people reply, and mentions get inundated. yay. 13857342 none
@dsmyxe @PolitiBunny the end result is the same. 13857342 none
@dsmyxe @PolitiBunny when you have that many followers, you know precisely what happens. 13857342 none

No, I'm not telling anyone what their score is. Then it'll just turn into a contest for GamerGate to try to 'win'. 13857342 none
See https://t.co/VHThRdRIYr thread for more info on how this is quantified. 13857342 none
@1Life0Continues part of the reason i'm not actively using it that much is because the weights of each factor are still being decided. 13857342 none
@1Life0Continues i've got the code to interpret &amp; analyze, but the weights themselves are going to take a lot of fiddling. 13857342 none

Yesterday, a dude that SWATed someone admitted that GamerGate - more specifically, someone on the GamerGate sourcelist - paid them to do so. 13857342 none
Now that person has been doxxed on 8chan. And despite this being the person who posted my &amp; others' home address, suddenly he sees a problem 13857342 none
I'm not going to say I told you so. However, I will say that you'll probably see this, and you know my email address if you need help. 13857342 none
It was incredibly fucking difficult to type that. 13857342 none
I doubt he'll bother emailing, but despite his past actions, no one should have to deal with shit like this. 13857342 none
@ChrisWarcraft I really just want to curl up and nap. But it seems quite a few people are dealing with doxxing fallout today on both sides. 13857342 none

@Trigger_Check the guy who paid. 13857342 none
Please stop with all of the karma/negative comments. There's a bigger issue here than the person that was targeted. 13857342 none
In many states, we've got laws that specifically protect against this kind of thing. However, they aren't enforced due to education/funding. 13857342 none
Feelings about the person involved need to be separated from the real issue, which is advocacy, education, law, and tools. 13857342 none
The current system is inadequate. Some of us are experienced at navigating these pitfalls, and we can help you. 13857342 none

I'm going to cut in here - despite blocking you - to explain something that seems to confuse many people. @PendragonTarot 13857342 none
This is a criminal case, not a civil case. This means that it's up to the police to decide if it's worth prosecuting. @PendragonTarot 13857342 none
While you can hire a lawyer to help you speak to the police, that's kind of where their - and YOUR - involvement ends. @PendragonTarot 13857342 none
If someone has had a crime committed personally against them online, the police aren't likely to listen to anyone BUT them. @PendragonTarot 13857342 none
This is not legal advice. but common sense. What I can do is help people know what to say to police or help find a lawyer. @PendragonTarot 13857342 none
So please take your accusations of "WHY AREN'T YOU PROSECUTING, EVIL ANTIGG SCUM" and go educate yourself. @PendragonTarot 13857342 none

Oh, hell. Is Blizzard proxying tweets instead of sending the tweet content directly to twitter from the WoW client? 13857342 none
I guess that's one way to get around the user token count limitation per app ID. 13857342 none
I need to think about this. I don't think I like this. 13857342 none
I think the biggest problem I have with it is that there's too much of a reliance on WoW services for an external mechanism. 13857342 none
Blizzard has had issues in the past with certain things being delayed (achievements, D3). I would strongly dislike a tweet being delayed. 13857342 none
I'm still not 100% certain this is happening. But the delay between sending a tweet and seeing it appear is far too long. 13857342 none
KISS (keep it simple, stupid) very much applies to designing a new feature. If Blizzard is proxying tweets, that's unnecessary and bad. 13857342 none

There is currently a vocal male on twitter that claims to be all about anti-harassment. He has defended GamerGate in the past. 13857342 none
At this moment in time, I am unaware of any effort he has made into this space. I'm tied in w/many orgs. His name has never once come up. 13857342 none
He's been offered contact info from those he's speaking with should he care to contribute. He's utilized none of this. I am unimpressed. 13857342 none
If you're interested in working on solutions, we'd love to have your help. However, I can spot a flail for media attention from a mile away. 13857342 none
Don't think that it won't go unnoticed/unchallenged. Don't put on a cape unless you plan on being a hero. It's not a photo op. It's a job. 13857342 none
@GavinRamblesOn what this person has done is not just voiced an opinion. i'm not going to get a pile-on going, so i'm not giving specifics. 13857342 none
Since this was questioned, I should be clear. I'm not talking about supporters, or just people with opinions. 13857342 none
I'm talking about people that take an active stand to say they want to create solutions for harassment, but do nothing beyond get RTed. 13857342 none
For everyone that is involved in this space, there's a huge personal risk. People get targeted. Friends and family get targeted. 13857342 none
Frankly, it's a little irritating to see some guy with a huge following come along and say "I'm gonna do stuff!" and then... do nothing. 13857342 none
Or, well, something happened. A hashtag was started by harassers to support him. So, that's something. I guess. 13857342 none
@GavinRamblesOn tbh, i feel bad anytime anyone actively enters this fight without knowing about the personal cost. 13857342 none
@a_man_in_black I'm not mentioning names for a few different reasons. 13857342 none
@tpstigers it depends on how you define meaningful. if 3 people listen to you vs 30k, there's a huge difference in voice. 13857342 none

@tpstigers as someone that went from ~4k followers to what i've got now, i've seen a huge difference. 13857342 none

@KaitlynBurnell the use of the word 'bully' in this context is worrisome and relevant to any conversation i have. 13857342 none

Twitter updates user safety features: https://t.co/ZaXmQwuZc5 13857342 none
My take on twitter's safety update: propaganda. Doesn't give clear info on what these new actions are. 13857342 none
Until twitter provides us with a way to filter new accounts or provides a higher barrier to entry, these are just words that mean little. 13857342 none
The Developer Policy needs an update that allows us to filter non-promoted tweets. Twitter clients continue to have bugs w/large block lists 13857342 none
I'm optimistic. This isn't the end game. Twitter's announcement was a single step in a long path in mitigating abuse problems. 13857342 none
@Sarcasshole @1lb_cake @Blacktric @DoUEvenPraise laid off, along with a whole game team. &lt;3 13857342 none

FYGM culture is a real issue. Like, "I fought my way here, and it sucked, but I'm strong. If you can't do this, it's your problem." 13857342 none
FYGM culture is a complete lack of empathy. I fought my way here, sure. Do I think anyone else should have to do that? Hell, no. 13857342 none
FYGM is keeping the status quo so you can feel some kind of superiority over the women that opted not to put up with the abuse. 13857342 none
Instead of perpetuating FYGM culture, why not try to fix things? Why not try to remove some of the hurdles? Would that be so bad, really? 13857342 none
If us women in tech are strong enough to get this far, why aren't we strong enough to mentor, to push for change? No more FYGM. 13857342 none

The thing is, you don't actually have to say any of that stuff for us to figure out who it's coming from. It's easy to track social groups. 13857342 none

In short, this is the most hilarious GamerGate BSD fail I have ever seen. #FreeBSD #OpenBSD #PCBSD http://t.co/poaOZ93QEf 13857342 none
btw, guys. I'm an admin of the OpenBSD facebook group. So, you know. COLLUSION. 13857342 none
RT @danimal: @freebsdgirl wait until they find out the BSDs share patches and fixes. 13857342 none
Oh, yeah. and FreeBSD is the OS that runs on your Playstations. Why so salty? 13857342 none
@iglvzx he expects unix logins to map to github usernames - which they rarely will. 13857342 none

@mdesjardins for some parts of the company, yes. a lot of freebsd devs work there. 13857342 none
@deathofrats01 yup. ^.^ unless it's your field, it's not surprising that you wouldn't know. 13857342 none

@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r but rogue isn't really... dev competent. he thinks all dev happens under github. 13857342 none
Watching other BSD devs tell roguestar he's wrong and it is delicious. 13857342 none
BSD is a good community. Wandering into it and attacking one of the few women contributors is going to get some people talking. 13857342 none
So, just to save you all some time, BSD is my family. The only negative response GG ever received was from a non-dev. 13857342 none
I have never felt more supported and safe than I do around the FreeBSD developer community. They are amazing, and I love them. 13857342 none
The smear tactics aren't going to work. These people have known me for over a decade. 13857342 none
So far, the primary response I've heard from the FreeBSD dev community in regards to all of this is "how can we help?" 13857342 none
And I've asked them to stay uninvolved. But attacking my work with them? GLHF. You're bringing it on yourself. 13857342 none
It's been several years since I've contributed code. This was due to a conflict with an employer. I *asked* for my commit bit to be retired. 13857342 none
But all of these attacks of "not enough commits" or "had a dude do it for you" or "slept with people" proves my point. Thanks for that. 13857342 none
@tmclaughbos @_RogueSt4r I think I got mine because no one else wanted to touch the code I was working with. :) 13857342 none

I gave it a 5 second glance, didn't see anything interesting. Getting mad about that is like raging at a livejournal post. Same quality. 13857342 none
I only really have the time to respond to mainstream media. Reviewing everything that GG writes about me would be too time consuming. 13857342 none
At least MSM manages to do basic fact checking, like not confusing @ggautoblocker with @theblockbot :P 13857342 none
@oolon you know this is like the only time a dude's code was ever incorrectly attributed to a chick, ever. :P 13857342 none

Watching GamerGate mock women that are concerned about appearing at GDC given the threats they've been inundated w/over the past 6 months. 13857342 none
Perpetuating a culture where abuse is tolerated and targets of abuse are mocked for speaking out against their abusers. 13857342 none
GamerGate is an intimidation mob. Speak up? Get threats &amp; dog-piled. Speak about the threats? Get mocked &amp; dog-piled. 13857342 none

@Jason_Gio meh. :P  thanks for the heads up, but not too concerned about another angry dude on twitter. 13857342 none
@Jason_Gio this is the same dude that thinks that not being allowed to publish an article to a site he doesn't own is "silencing" 13857342 none
@Jason_Gio so his opinion on being blocked on twitter is probably fairly predictable. 13857342 none

Bonus points in this thread. Unreal. Harassment from GamerGate did make abuse more of a topic, I suppose. http://t.co/98FNXeb9nW 13857342 none
@KaitlynBurnell beats me. I was sent the screencap. 13857342 none
It's human to react negatively to abuse. Trying to blame someone for reacting to abuse is, unsurprisingly, a tactic of serial abusers. 13857342 none
RT @ahtweet: @freebsdgirl How dare you have feelings is a fantastic way to dehumanize someone. 13857342 none
This is commonly found in cases of domestic violence, but it's a favored tactic of GamerGate as well. 13857342 none
It's another form of abuse, but more insidious, because the perpetrators think they are the heroes of this story. 13857342 none

@LyalinDotCom we'll see. i'm still figuring out what our tech &amp; infra concerns are going to be. :) 13857342 none
@truth4ever87 @SMCadman @itsmenanice yeah, not good to go assuming all abuse happens around GG. that's just not the case. 13857342 none

Listening to @twoscooters talk about how harassment is important. And how we are going to help you through it. 13857342 none
"I'm bringing it up for one reason. GamerGate has brought harassment into the limelight, but rest assured, it's always there." 13857342 none
This is a problem that affects everyone, but we have seen far more harassment targeting women. 13857342 none
It is fitting that we are now seeing these strong women speaking out and trying to fix problems that others are uncertain of how to tackle. 13857342 none
Oh gosh she mentioned me and #ggautoblocker in her talk and now I am blushing and trying not to sniffle. 13857342 none
In this ongoing tragedy, we found our voices &amp; each other. We have learned to work together, and to support &amp; encourage these amazing women. 13857342 none
I can't even find the words to describe how much I value the work of all the people I've met during this time. How much I love all of them. 13857342 none
We talk about GamerGate a lot. But the truth is, GamerGate isn't the real battle. It's a symptom of a larger problem. 13857342 none
Online harassment is something most people have faced at some point, regardless of their views on ethics in games journalism. 13857342 none
It's a really tough problem, because it's a BIG problem. It is far reaching. It has many different forms. 13857342 none
The scope of the problem can discourage people from trying to fight it. Often this leads to thinking, "what can I do? I'm just one person." 13857342 none
You aren't just one person. There are many of us, and we all have voices. But more than that, we have resources, experience, and passion. 13857342 none
You aren't alone in this. You're never alone in this. 13857342 none
We have seen so many fantastic things happen out of this tragedy. First, we have @femfreq. Amazing advocacy. A voice that is far reaching. 13857342 none
We have @crashoverridenw, an invaluable resource that provides emotional support for targets of harassment. 13857342 none
Both of these organizations have been created to address different aspects of very real problems that affect all of us. 13857342 none
It's almost time. :) 13857342 none
Soon soon soon 13857342 none

Today, I am happy to announce the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative, created with @TheQuinnspiracy, @alexlifschitz, &amp; @SheriRubin. 13857342 none
OAPI will focus on creating technical solutions for online abuse. http://t.co/Gh10Nt5rEB 13857342 none
OAPI is already working with several tech companies to develop &amp; engineer solutions for social problems. We are tech advocates for the user. 13857342 none
OAPI will be partnering with @crashoverridenw to provide them with the tools they need. 13857342 none
We're creating tools and resources for individuals. We're working directly with companies on developer policies to make this a reality. 13857342 none
We know what online abuse looks like. We've been studying it, and we will create reports and publish our findings. 13857342 none
I'm so excited about this. We're already doing some great things, and I can't wait until I'm able to tell you more. 13857342 none
Hahahaha http://t.co/JRPkJCNVH9 13857342 none

At some point in the future, we will be allowing external developers to contribute. @A_Round_Square 13857342 none

I'm an employee of that non-profit. I pay the same taxes on my salary as an employee of a for-profit. They are repeating some weird stuff. 13857342 none

RT @Kotaku: How Blizzard is taking aim at toxic players in Heroes of the Storm: http://t.co/Ukt4trogVl http://t.co/mrMRW6TcwX 13857342 none
I like the way Blizzard is tackling toxic players in Heroes of the Storm. It's a good first step. 13857342 none
Creating a reporting system is difficult, because of the human intervention and level of bias that is involved. 13857342 none
For more egregious cases for harassment, we definitely need to be able to respond to those appropriately. But most toxicity isn't this. 13857342 none
Having a high level of toxicity in your community can lead to more serious cases of harassment and abuse, so we need to tackle this head on. 13857342 none
Putting the tools into the hands of users is a GREAT idea. We need more active solutions for protecting ourselves. 13857342 none
One of my least favorite things is sending an abuse complaint into the void of a ticketing system and waiting for a human. We can do better. 13857342 none
@ELLIOTTCABLE the only info i've got is the kotaku article I just RTed. :) 13857342 none
Gaming companies are rarely *tech* companies. That's not their core competency, but they deal with inordinate amounts of abuse. 13857342 none
@Cactus_Soup90 difficult to write those with current limitations of developer policy. 13857342 none
Users want transparency in abuse systems, but there's a difficulty in this. It can allow people to game the system. 13857342 none
@tpstigers GDC has been amazing. We've been waiting for this. 13857342 none

@mistertodd hoping we'll be able to release more info soon. :) Lots of stuff in the works. I promise big things. 13857342 none
@ashleylynch I'll keep that in mind. :) At some point, I could see it going there - but not on our roadmap for at least 9-12 months. 13857342 none
@ashleylynch o_O   that's appreciated greatly. going to be releasing some financial info soon. 13857342 none
GDC was great today. Thank you for letting me be a small part of your world. But it's time to (literally) take off my cape and go to bed. :) 13857342 none
OK, yeah. No GDC today. Coughing. Too much to do next week, can't risk full-blown ConSARS. 13857342 none

@twoscooters @Official_PAX @ShaofHappiness i am not surprised in the slightest. i wish that i was. 13857342 none
@twoscooters @Official_PAX keep in mind that PA put a sexual predator in charge of security and then brushed it under the rug 2yrs ago 13857342 none
Sickened but not surprised by what happened at PAX earlier today. PAX has a history of making poor decisions at the cost of women's safety. 13857342 none

Here's an idea. How about the ability to mute someone for N period of time? 13857342 none
So it would auto-unmute after N hours, or whatever. 13857342 none
@srhbutts @snipeyhead yeah. it was pretty accurate. I don't see why that dude thought that these were bad things. 13857342 none
@cwalker iirc, tweetbot is a paid app. :)  i'm not necessarily thinking full-fledged client. 13857342 none
@bradjgreer ooo, i like that. 13857342 none

There's one particular person that has tweeted about me more than 40 times in the past 12 hours. This has been her pattern for the &gt;1 week. 13857342 none
She's trying to summon a mob, making false allegations about OAPI, and in general, acting... worrisome. Pondering if I need to lawyer up. 13857342 none
I'm not really concerned when it comes to gaters being gatery about *me*, but regarding this org, that's a problem. 13857342 none
@athenahollow i've been mostly ignoring it, but she's clearly fixated and making weird accusations. has never once directly talked to me. 13857342 none
@athenahollow i suppose i have to get used to the idea of bloggers using my name to get hits. but slightly irritated. 13857342 none
@devesine @CrashOverrideNW eh, this is turning into more of a legal concern. 13857342 none
@athenahollow no doubt. i don't really have the time for lawsuits, so it's a question of resource allocation vs benefit. 13857342 none
@athenahollow on one hand, the only voice she has is with gaters - which doesn't really affect OAPI's reach. 13857342 none
@athenahollow but on the other hand, it sends a message. and i'm not used to having to be concerned about an org's image vs my own. 13857342 none

@wetsprocket there are some statements made which are obvious slander (ie: what I do with funds w/Patreon, wth?), claims of fraud. 13857342 none
@wetsprocket but given that these people seem to not understand the difference between charity and NPO, why bother giving them my time? 13857342 none

GamerGate loves to flood @join_oapi so we won't see any legitimate harassment complaints that come in. :\ 13857342 none
It's unfortunate, because I'd like to leave twitter as an avenue available to GamerGaters that have been targeted. 13857342 none
But I'm going to have to mass-mute or mass-block. GamerGate would prefer that we aren't able to help their own people. 13857342 none

Things I am scared of:  Small red lights in dark rooms. Drive through carwashes. Large spiders. Not being able to afford Blackmilk. 13857342 none
Things I am not scared of:  Whiny manbabies. A lot of twitter mentions. Public speaking. Perl. Standing up for those that are afraid. FEELS. 13857342 none
Yeah, I get threats. And it means I have to be cautious. But really, I'm crazy enough to think I'm unbreakable, which is why this works. 13857342 none
I could get hurt. Someone could come after me. Hell, people have shown up at my office before. I've been doxxed. I've been threatened. 13857342 none
So I don't think about it. Instead, I use it as fuel. I'd rather try to fix this so others don't have to go through this, too. 13857342 none
That's why we have @join_oapi. Because going on the internet without fearing for your life should be a basic human right. 13857342 none
Combating online harassment doesn't mean jerks won't exist. Everyone is a jerk, sometimes. But you shouldn't ever be afraid. 13857342 none
Online harassment takes many forms. Some is actionable, by the service provider (ToS) or law enforcement. 13857342 none
We seek to help clarify those policies and gain better enforcement, as well as provide users with the power to filter what they experience. 13857342 none
@beardyblue never feel bad about that. it's pretty intense if you're not prepared for it. 13857342 none
@beardyblue it takes a pretty specific personality type to be able to take this shit on voluntarily. 13857342 none
There's no one-size-fits-all answer for online harassment. But we're in this for the long haul. We've got ideas. We will help. 13857342 none

We're already privately working with a number of tech companies. Relationships are being built. We're making HUGE amounts of progress. 13857342 none

If your company has an abuse, social media, or community team, we want to talk. All industries welcome. info@onlineabuseprevention.org 13857342 none

@MummyyJoy Anyone who believes that you can have compromise or power sharing with people of an absolutist Islamic mindset is delusional. 2941145694 none
@nwOryzen @ChristophHeer52 There was no US coup in Ukraine, microbrain. 2941145694 none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 There were never any neo Nazis involved.  That is simply Russian propaganda. 2941145694 none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 It goes on the assumption that the admiration of Stephan Bandera means support for a Nazi ideology.  False. 2941145694 none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 First, Bandera fought for Nazis, but he was also in a Nazi prison. 2941145694 none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 Bandera's joining with Nazis was to rid Ukraine of Soviets, and had no relationship to him supporting ideology. 2941145694 none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 Same applies to 14th Waffen SS.  They fought for Nazis to get rid of Soviets.  They never had..... 2941145694 none
@joanneleon @ChristophHeer52 ... Nazi ideological indoctrination. And wiki will tell you that half the world's neo Nazis live in Russia. 2941145694 none
@nwOryzen Borrowed from Q on Startrek. 2941145694 none
@MummyyJoy It is the same mindset of all Islamic terrorist groups.  And there are over 100 of them. 2941145694 none
@nwOryzen Again, you jump to unsupported conclusions, just like your absurd coup idea. 2941145694 none
@nwOryzen @_DirtyTruths ROFL.  You really do have more than one screw lose. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Sanctions didn't kill anyone, birdbrain.  There were no sanctions against Iraq buying food. You people are as deluded as ever. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths And you pick the same old lying scab until you finally die. 2941145694 none
@PeterClifford1 Glad to hear that, Peter.  And I will respect your assessment. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths The problem is in your lie that the deaths were caused by US sanctions.  Purchase of food by Iraq was never sanctioned. 2941145694 none
@MummyyJoy They learn it from the Quran and Hadiths.  Like these. http://t.co/XlPuwOeogW 2941145694 none
@MummyyJoy Sorry. Twitter missed on sending that tweet.  Answer should now be present. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Okay, microbrain, show me proof that the sanctions included food or medicine and stop babbling about experts. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths ROFL.  Genocide denier?  LOL.  Okay, I didn't realize I was talking to the lunatic left fringe.  Have a nice day. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Wikipedia says that there were no sanctions against food and medicine.  Try again, microbrain. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Not only were there no sanctions against food and medicine, but Sadam was allowed to sell oil in exchange for food &amp; medicine. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths I guess while your trying to shove your sanctimoniousness at people you can't read your forehead. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Who cares about some loony opinions. The facts are that there were no sanctions against food or medicine. Any idiot can verify 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths You blabber on endlessly without presenting a single fact.  Show where we sanctioned food and medicine or shut up. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths We are not arguing deaths.  We are arguing the cause.  Sadam was the cause, not sanctions. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths No, like the idiot leftist that you are, you believe that endless repetition constitutes truth. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Just drone mindlessly on if you like. By now you could have actually brought some facts to the table.  But you have none. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Repeating "as everyone knows" is your way of saying that you just sit around and repeat the BS of your left wing clones. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths So where is your evidence of the intentional destruction of water.  Give me a link to facts, not opinions. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths To divide? 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Again, like an idiot you give the opinions of people like you, with no facts. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Printing some BS from an unsourced, US hating conspiracy nut like yourself does not constitute evidence of anything. 2941145694 none
@MummyyJoy The Saudis pay for a lot of them. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths So at the moment, I'm busy trying to track down the sources of your conspiracy theories. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths The first one seems to come from the far left wing rag, The Progressive. The article is by Thomas Nagy. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths The article is called, "The Secret behind the Sanctions, How the US intentionally destroyed Iraq's water supply" 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Of the three papers that he references, I have so far only been able to locate the third. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Here is the paper. http://t.co/zv46NuwUJL In reading it I find nothing to support the allegations. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths I'm going to continue looking for the other papers to see if they help his case or show it to be politically motivated. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths Certainly the paper shows that the idea that drinking water was the only or main health issue in Iraq is a lie. 2941145694 none
@_DirtyTruths I don't follow any religion, microbrain. 2941145694 none

@asem_1994 You are a liar. Copernicus never said that he borrowed his main concept from anyone. 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 Al Battani never had Copernicus' concept. Al Battani only made the same observations as Ptolemy more accurately. Big deal. 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 I see no reason to. 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 Kahlili wrote a good book explaining Quantum theory that I read. But his opinions on Muslim scientists are hyperbolic. 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 Read Ibn Warraq on the contribution of Muslims to science in his book, "Why I am not a Muslim" 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 Try to figure out why Christianity and Judaism had an enlightenment but Islam never had one. 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 My ideas are too extensive to explain with twitter. Read Ibn Warraq. http://t.co/ZnkTIwbhMO 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 Yes, Islam, Judism, Christianity are all Abrahamic religions. But science can only advance when it get's past superstition. 2941145694 none
@greenlinerzjm The best Muslims are the ones who ignore most of what is in the Quran and Hadiths. ISIS doesn't ignore any of it. 2941145694 none
@greenlinerzjm I've read the entire Quran. How old are you? 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 The first "colonizers" or "crusaders" were Muslims who attacked Europe 400 years before the Christian crusades. 2941145694 none
@greenlinerzjm Tell me how old you are. I don't want to be here attacking a child about her religion. 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 Of course the Muslims were doing the same to each other. The question is, can civilization move beyond religious barbarism. 2941145694 none
@asem_1994 And the Turks were conducting the Armenian genocide in the last century. Again, the question is, can we get beyond religious hate 2941145694 none

@haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue What does your Quran 33:33 say? 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @MelBiebs69 @biebervalue @greenlinerzjm What does your Quran 33:33 say? 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @biebervalue @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm I'm still waiting. Let's all go to same Quran verses and see who's lying. 2941145694 none
@haroonstyles @halalflaws @biebervalue Come on morons, let's all go to the same verses in our own Quran. Start with 33:33. Are you afraid? 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue What does your Quran 33:33 say? 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Do the Taliban lock women up at home like 33:33 tells them? 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Come on. Let's do it one verse at a time. Everybody verify what it says. 2941145694 none
@haroonstyles @MelBiebs69 @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue What does your Quran 33:33 say? 2941145694 none
@pixieyas @halalflaws @biebervalue @greenlinerzjm Go look up the word Taquiyya. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @islamdefense @halalflaws @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm And what does your Quran 33:33 say. Come on. Anybody. 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue What does 33:33 say? 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Don't feed me propaganda. Tell me what 33:33 says. 2941145694 none

@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue We can get to that later. Let's stick with one issue and cover it. 33:33? 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Stop changing subjects. What does your 33:33 say? 2941145694 none

@AMohedin It tells women to stay at home right? http://t.co/GSwtH7nLHF 2941145694 none
@AMohedin Can we all agree that 33:33 tells women to stay at home? 2941145694 none
@AMohedin And it tells women not to display themselves, right? 2941145694 none
@haroonstyles Okay, you had your chance at an honest discussion. Now you are blocked. 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 @haroonstyles @halalflaws @greenlinerzjm @biebervalue Do we agree that Islam tells women to stay at home and not display? 2941145694 none
@MelBiebs69 So when Taliban make women stay home and wear Burquas are they not implementing 33:33? 2941145694 none
@AMohedin No it is only talking to women. So are the Taliban and ISIS and Saudis not implementing 33:33 when they force women home? 2941145694 none
@AMohedin When the Taliban make women wear Burquas are they not preventing women from "displaying themselves"? 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm No, it says this. http://t.co/zpGYjCBUNb 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @AMohedin @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm Now show me the screen or photo of yours. Or type it. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin Show me the verse where it says that it is forbidden to force people into doing something. 2941145694 none
@halalflaws I don't see your 33:33. Only something about a house and can't breath. What does that have to do with 33:33. 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @islamdefense @AMohedin @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm This is your tweet. It is not 33:33. http://t.co/IBM4xjcoYd 2941145694 none
@AMohedin Stop making up lies. Show me with a verse. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin So now that we know that Islam tells women to stay at home, we can move on to the subject of forcing women to obey. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin And here we have it.  What does your 4:34 say? http://t.co/WqDcjxsTT4 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm Why? 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @islamdefense @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm What does your 4:34 say? Same as these? http://t.co/euBhAxWUDK 2941145694 none
@AMohedin But the Quran says that verses can be abrogated, right? Now let's get to compulsion later. What does 4:34 say? 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @islamdefense @AMohedin @haroonstyles @greenlinerzjm You are babbling. 33:33 says this. http://t.co/FbpPSnaLnD 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @islamdefense Stay on 33:33 until we agree what it says. http://t.co/M53tWoA8cr 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I read the whole. It doesn't change 33:33 at all. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin No, it clearly says to beat them. The rest are other options. "Beat them" is there in black and white. Not what you say. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin No, not going to bed with her is a seperate option. There is no "mentally". 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Only two verses and we are making progress. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin Okay, so let's try one more verse. What does your 2:282 say? http://t.co/OrYnUooi5n 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm So your claim is that me are physically superior, right? 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Not talking about what you choose to do. I'm talking about what Islam says. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Beating her was not recommended, but allowed. 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Actually he hit Aisha. But I don't have time for that now. 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @AMohedin @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm What does your 2:282 say? http://t.co/hxSgcsx5fm 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I would have to do a search, so let's forget that one for now. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm You can deny it until I prove it. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin It doesn't require muscles to be a witness. So can we assume the lack is mental or emotional. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm And because of 4:34, beating would not be a reason in a Sharia court. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I've got 4 translations that say hit and one that says scourge. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Who's translation are you using? 2941145694 none
@AMohedin We can get that much from the Quran. So maybe the Hadiths can help us clarify. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin So these are Hadiths that I copied from the USC Muslim students Hadith database. Look them up for yourself. http://t.co/UdWmDtxxDw 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Why do you think all the translators use strike? 2941145694 none
@AMohedin Not unless you can get 5 professional translators to agree. 2941145694 none
@halalflaws @haroonstyles @AMohedin @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I got help. Five professional translators that all say strike. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin But the five professional translators, many of them Muslims, do know Arabic. For some it is their first language. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin Even Pickthall, who is an Englishman, was a Muslim convert. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin 4:34 is in the Quran not the Hadith. And you don't explain why 5 translators would use strike. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm The translators knew Arabic, so they are right. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm The translations are on a Muslim web site and they say strike. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm But let's go on to the Hadith that refers back to 2.282. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm In that Hadith it says the reason is that women lack intelligence. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I'll give it to you again. http://t.co/8ov7jyscmm 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm So I decided to give you one more chance even beyond the 5 translators. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm I cut out 4:34 in Arabic and stuck it into Google translate. 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Here is a screen shot of what I got. http://t.co/562Ckt6sEZ 2941145694 none
@AMohedin @halalflaws @haroonstyles @islamdefense @greenlinerzjm Google translate used the word "beat". I hope that settles it. 2941145694 none

@pNibbler @AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal Basically, death for apostacy and for adultery are a part of Sharia. So you can say that 1.1 out of 1.6 2941145694 none
@pNibbler @AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal They support the death penalty for murder, not for leaving Christianity. 2941145694 none
@pNibbler @AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal But it doesn't matter what they support, since we have separation of Church and state. 2941145694 none
@pNibbler @AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal I don't care if someone believes that. As long as they don't assert the right to kill me for leaving. 2941145694 none
@pNibbler @AlterNet @MaxBlumenthal The US implemented separation of church and state at a time when US was far more Christian than today. 2941145694 none

@AnasMechch I don't follow. Are you saying the same guy is in ISIS and leads the Shia militia? 2941145694 none
@AnasMechch ISIS are all Sunni. ISIS hates the Shia. One guy cannot be both ISIS and a leader of the Shia militia. 2941145694 none
